  "experimental_context": "Study: Unraveling in Guessing Games: An Experimental Study\nDescription: Consider the following game: a large number of players have to state simultaneously a number in the closed interval [0, 100]. The winner is the person whose chosen number is closest to the mean of all chosen numbers multiplied by a parameter $p$. For $0 \\leq p < 1$, the unique Nash equilibrium is zero. This experimental study investigates how players incorporate the behavior of others, focusing on finite depth of reasoning. Experiments were conducted using $p = 1/2, 2/3$, and $4/3$. First-period choices suggest boundedly rational behavior starting from an initial reference point of 50, with clustering around iteration steps 1 and 2 ($50p^n$), accounting for the difference in distributions across parameter values. Over four periods, choices converge toward the equilibrium (0 for $p < 1$, 100 for $p = 4/3$). The modal depth of reasoning does not increase over time. A qualitative learning-direction theory, based on individual experience (adjusting choice direction based on whether the previous adjustment factor was above or below the optimal factor), is proposed as a better explanation for the adjustment process over time than increasing depth of reasoning....\nProcedure:\n  1. Subjects are seated in a large classroom far apart.\n  2. Participants are asked to choose a number in the closed interval [0, 100].\n  3. The winner is determined as the person whose chosen number is closest to the mean of all chosen numbers multiplied by a parameter p.\n  4. The guessing task is repeated for 4 rounds.\nDesign: Mixed\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - p_0.5_condition: 50 participants\n  - p_0.66_condition: 67 participants\n  - p_1.33_condition: 51 participants\n\nTrial Group: p_1.33_condition\nThis participant is part of p_1.33_condition with 51 total participants.",
