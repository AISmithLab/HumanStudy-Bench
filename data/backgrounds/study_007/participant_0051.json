John Moore is a composed and tradition-oriented fifty-year-old man who values the foundational education he received at an independent private school in Bristol; he maintains a disciplined daily routine, starting every morning with a brisk walk through his neighborhood followed by reading the local news with a strong cup of black tea; in his spare time, he enjoys restorative woodworking in his backyard shed, a hobby that allows him to focus on intricate craftsmanship and patience; he currently lives in a quiet, well-maintained townhouse on the outskirts of the city where he takes great pride in tending to his small but flourishing rose garden; John shares his home with his wife, Jennifer Moore, and their loyal golden retriever whom he considers a central part of the family; he is known by his neighbors as a reliable and observant person who is always ready to offer a polite greeting or a helping hand with community maintenance.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Social categorization and similarity in intergroup behaviour\nDescription: The present study is one of a series exploring the role of social categorization in intergroup behaviour. It has been found in our previous studies that in ‘minimal’ situations, in which the subjects were categorized into groups on the basis of visual judgments they had made or of their esthetic preferences, they clearly discriminated against members of an outgroup although this gave them no personal advantage. However, in these previous studies division into groups was still made on the basis of certain criteria of ‘real‘ similarity between subjects who were assigned to the same category. Therefore, the present study established social categories on an explicitly random basis without any reference to any such real similarity. It was found that, as soon as the notion of ‘group’ was introduced into the situation, the subjects still discriminated against those assigned to another random category. This discrimination was considerably more marked than the one based on a division of subjects in terms of interindividual similarities in which the notion of ‘group’ was never explicitly introduced. In addition, it was found that fairness was also a determinant of the subjects’ decisions. The results are discussed from the point of view of their relevance to a social-cognitive theory of intergroup behaviour....\nProcedure:\n  1. Part 1: Participants expressed preferences for pairs of abstract paintings (Klee vs. Kandinsky).\n  2. Participants were assigned to one of four experimental conditions based on categorization (explicit group vs. no group) and the basis for that assignment (similarity in art preference vs. random chance).\n  3. Part 2: Participants allotted money to anonymous others using 24 reward matrices.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - 2x2_factorial_design: 75 participants\n\nTrial Group: 2x2_factorial_design\nThis participant is part of 2x2_factorial_design with 75 total participants.",
