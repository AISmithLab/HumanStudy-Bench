  "experimental_context": "Study: Pluralistic Ignorance and Alcohol Use on Campus: Some Consequences of Misperceiving the Social Norm\nDescription: Four studies examined the relation between college students' own attitudes toward alcohol use and their estimates of the attitudes of their peers. All studies found widespread evidence of pluralistic ignorance: Students believed that they were more uncomfortable with campus alcohol practices than was the average student. Study 2 demonstrated this perceived self-other difference also with respect to one's friends. Study 3 tracked attitudes toward drinking over the course of a semester and found gender differences in response to perceived deviance: Male students shifted their attitudes over time in the direction of what they mistakenly believed to be the norm, whereas female students showed no such attitude change. Study 4 found that students' perceived deviance correlated with various measures of campus alienation, even though that deviance was illusory. The implications of these results for general issues of norm estimation and responses to perceived deviance are discussed....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants rated their own comfort or attitude toward campus alcohol habits or specific policies (e.g., keg ban).\n  2. Participants estimated the comfort or attitude of the average undergraduate student.\n  3. In Study 1, participants estimated the interquartile range of the student body's attitudes by bracketing values between which 50% of students fall.\n  4. In Study 2, participants also rated the comfort level of their friends.\n  5. In Study 2, the order of questions (self first vs. average student first) was manipulated.\n  6. In Study 4, participants indicated their willingness to take social action (collecting signatures, spending time discussing protests).\n  7. In Study 4, participants indicated their connection to the university (expected reunion attendance, likelihood of donating money).\nDesign: Mixed\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - study_1_comfort_estimation: 132 participants\n  - study_2_order_and_friend_comparison: 242 participants\n  - study_4_keg_ban_alienation: 94 participants\n\nTrial Group: study_1_comfort_estimation\nThis participant is part of study_1_comfort_estimation with 132 total participants.",
