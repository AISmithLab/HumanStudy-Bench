  "experimental_context": "Study: Thinking through Uncertainty: Nonconsequential Reasoning and Choice\nDescription: When thinking under uncertainty, people often do not consider appropriately each of the relevant branches of a decision tree, as required by consequentialism. As a result they sometimes violate Savage’s sure-thing principle. In the Prisoner’s Dilemma game, for example, many subjects compete when they know that the opponent has competed and when they know that the opponent has cooperated, but cooperate when they do not know the opponent’s response. Newcomb’s Problem and Wason’s selection task are also interpreted as manifestations of nonconsequential decision making and reasoning. The causes and implications of such behavior, and the notion of quasi-magical thinking, are discussed....\nProcedure:\n  1. Subjects played a series of 40 one-shot games, including Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) games against different opponents.\n  2. PD games were presented in triads consisting of three versions: opponent strategy unknown, opponent known to have competed, and opponent known to have cooperated.\n  3. PD games were interspersed with other two-person games to prevent the development of standard strategies.\n  4. Subjects participated in a version of Newcomb's problem involving two boxes (A and B) and a computer program that predicted their choice with 92% success.\n  5. Subjects chose between taking both Box A and Box B or taking only Box B.\n  6. A separate group of subjects played PD games and were offered the opportunity to pay a small fee to learn the opponent's decision before making their own choice.\nDesign: Mixed\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 80 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 40 participants\n  - Experiment 3: 0 participants",
