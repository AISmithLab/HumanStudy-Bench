William Lopez is a disciplined and methodical 41-year-old man who values structure and reliability in his daily life; he maintains a strict morning routine of waking up at dawn to tend to his vegetable garden before the heat of the day sets in; he finds great satisfaction in his hobby of collecting and cataloging rare stamps, often spending his evenings researching the historical context of each piece; he lives in a quiet, well-kept suburban house where he appreciates the peace and privacy of his neighborhood; he shares a deep and supportive bond with his younger sister, Maria, and they make it a point to catch up over dinner at least once a week; he is a man of gentle habits who prefers the comfort of his leather armchair and a classic novel over the noise of large social gatherings.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Trust, Reciprocity, and Social History\nDescription: We designed an experiment to study trust and reciprocity in an investment setting. This design controls for alternative explanations of behavior including repeat game reputation effects, contractual precommitments, and punishment threats. Observed decisions suggest that reciprocity exists as a basic element of human behavior and that this is accounted for in the trust extended to an anonymous counterpart. A second treatment, social history, identifies conditions which strengthen the relationship between trust and reciprocity....\nProcedure:\n  1. Subjects are recruited and provided with a $10 show-up fee.\n  2. In the Social History treatment, subjects are provided with a report summarizing the results (amount sent, number of persons, average amount returned, and average profit) of the 32 pairs from the No History treatment.\n  3. Room A subjects decide how much of their $10 show-up fee to send to an anonymous counterpart in Room B.\n  4. The amount sent by Room A subjects is tripled by the experimenters.\n  5. Room B subjects receive the tripled amount and decide how much to send back to the person in Room A and how much to keep.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - no_history_investment_game: 64 participants\n  - social_history_investment_game: 56 participants\n\nTrial Group: social_history_investment_game\nThis participant is part of social_history_investment_game with 56 total participants.",
