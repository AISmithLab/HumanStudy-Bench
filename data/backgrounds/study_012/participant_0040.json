  "experimental_context": "Study: Trust, Reciprocity, and Social History\nDescription: We designed an experiment to study trust and reciprocity in an investment setting. This design controls for alternative explanations of behavior including repeat game reputation effects, contractual precommitments, and punishment threats. Observed decisions suggest that reciprocity exists as a basic element of human behavior and that this is accounted for in the trust extended to an anonymous counterpart. A second treatment, social history, identifies conditions which strengthen the relationship between trust and reciprocity....\nProcedure:\n  1. Subjects are recruited and provided with a $10 show-up fee.\n  2. In the Social History treatment, subjects are provided with a report summarizing the results (amount sent, number of persons, average amount returned, and average profit) of the 32 pairs from the No History treatment.\n  3. Room A subjects decide how much of their $10 show-up fee to send to an anonymous counterpart in Room B.\n  4. The amount sent by Room A subjects is tripled by the experimenters.\n  5. Room B subjects receive the tripled amount and decide how much to send back to the person in Room A and how much to keep.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - no_history_investment_game: 64 participants\n  - social_history_investment_game: 56 participants\n\nTrial Group: no_history_investment_game\nThis participant is part of no_history_investment_game with 64 total participants.",
