Paul Lopez is a disciplined and thoughtful man who carries the academic rigor of his Israeli preparatory school education into his adult life; he maintains a strict morning routine consisting of physical exercise followed by a quiet hour dedicated to reading historical non-fiction; Paul enjoys spending his weekends hiking through scenic nature trails or practicing traditional Mediterranean cooking techniques in his kitchen; he lives in a meticulously organized apartment in a quiet neighborhood that reflects his preference for order and tranquility; Paul stays in close contact with his extended family and deeply values the small, tight-knit circle of friends he has known for years; he is recognized by his peers for his unwavering punctuality and his habit of always keeping a handwritten journal of his daily observations.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
