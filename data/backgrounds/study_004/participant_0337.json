Sarah Brown is a thoughtful and disciplined woman who values the rich cultural background she gained from her education at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she begins every morning with a ritual of brewing dark coffee and tending to the many flowering plants on her balcony; Sarah finds great joy in the hobby of perfecting complex Mediterranean recipes that remind her of home; she lives in a quiet, sun-drenched townhome where she enjoys the peaceful atmosphere of her private library; Sarah cherishes the deep connection she has with her childhood friend, Rebecca, with whom she speaks every weekend; she makes it a habit to visit the local farmer's market every Saturday to source fresh ingredients for her weekly meal preparations.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
