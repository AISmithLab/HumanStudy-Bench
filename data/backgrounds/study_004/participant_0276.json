Barbara Jones is a disciplined and thoughtful woman who takes great pride in her organizational skills and her ability to remain calm under pressure; she maintains a strict morning routine of drinking strong coffee while reading international news, a habit she cultivated during her years at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; Barbara lives in a quiet suburban home that she keeps meticulously tidy and filled with various succulents; she enjoys spending her weekends tending to her backyard garden and practicing her linguistic skills by reading Hebrew literature; she shares a deep bond with her younger sister, whom she calls every Sunday afternoon to catch up on family news; every evening, she takes a brisk walk through her neighborhood to unwind and reflect on her day.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
