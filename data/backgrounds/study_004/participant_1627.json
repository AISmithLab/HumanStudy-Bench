Lisa Smith is a detail-oriented and organized individual who values the discipline she learned during her college-preparatory high school years in Israel; she starts every morning with a cup of strong coffee while reading international news to stay connected with global events; in her free time, she enjoys cultivating a small herb garden on her balcony and cooking traditional Mediterranean recipes for her close friends; Lisa currently lives in a bright, modern apartment that she takes great pride in keeping tidy and welcoming; she maintains strong bonds with her extended family and regularly participates in video calls with her former classmates to reminisce about their school days; known for her reliable and warm nature, she is always the first person her neighbors turn to when they need a helping hand or a thoughtful conversation.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
