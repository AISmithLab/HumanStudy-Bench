Charles Garcia is a disciplined and thoughtful 45-year-old man who carries the values of his rigorous education from college-preparatory high schools in Israel into every aspect of his life; he maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a long walk at sunrise to clear his mind before the day's tasks begin; in his spare time, Charles enjoys restoring vintage fountain pens and practicing calligraphy, finding peace in the precision required for such delicate work; he lives in a quiet, modern apartment overlooking a bustling city park, where he appreciates the balance between urban energy and natural beauty; Charles shares a close bond with his younger sister, Elena, whom he calls every Sunday morning to discuss books and their shared childhood memories; he is well-regarded by his neighbors for his reliable nature and often spends his Saturday afternoons helping the local community garden maintain its irrigation system.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
