David Moore is a disciplined and thoughtful 41-year-old man who values structure and clear communication in his daily life; David maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a cup of strong coffee and a review of his meticulously organized planner; having attended college-preparatory high schools in Israel, David enjoys keeping his mind sharp by playing competitive chess and reading historical non-fiction; David lives in a quiet, sun-drenched apartment that he keeps meticulously tidy and decorated with travel mementos; David cherishes his long-standing friendships from his school days and makes it a point to call his parents every Sunday evening; he is a man of habit who finds great peace in his nightly ritual of walking through the local park to reflect on his day.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
