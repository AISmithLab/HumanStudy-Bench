Joseph Jones is a thoughtful and disciplined man who carries the academic rigor of his Israeli college-preparatory education into his daily life; he maintains a strict morning routine of meditation and drinking black coffee while reviewing his personal goals for the day; Joseph lives alone in a modern studio apartment filled with historical biographies and keeps his living space meticulously organized; he spends his weekends hiking local trails and photographing nature as a way to stay active and creative; Joseph is a loyal friend who regularly hosts small dinner parties for a close-knit group of former classmates; he deeply values his weekly video calls with his parents to stay connected with his family heritage.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
