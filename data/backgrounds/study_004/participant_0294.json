Barbara Jackson is a thoughtful and disciplined individual who values order and precision in her daily life; she takes great pride in her academic background, having attended college-preparatory high schools in Israel where she developed a strong work ethic; Barbara currently lives in a quiet suburban neighborhood with her two golden retrievers, Max and Bella, who are her constant companions; every morning, she starts her day with a brisk walk through the local park followed by a cup of strong black coffee while reading the news; in her free time, she enjoys practicing landscape photography and tending to her extensive indoor garden of succulents and orchids; she maintains a close relationship with her younger brother, David, and they make it a point to share a homemade meal together every Sunday evening.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
