Betty Brown is a 39-year-old woman who values organization and discipline, traits she developed while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she follows a strict morning routine that includes a brisk walk through her neighborhood followed by a quiet moment of reflection over a cup of herbal tea; Betty spends much of her free time volunteering at a local community center and pursuing her passion for landscape photography; she lives in a well-kept townhouse in a quiet suburban area where she enjoys the peace of her private garden; Betty shares a deep and supportive bond with her aging parents and often hosts small dinner parties for her close-knit circle of friends; she has a habit of reading at least one new book every week to keep her mind sharp and stay informed about the world around her.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
