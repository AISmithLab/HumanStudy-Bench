Anthony Hernandez is a disciplined and methodical 42-year-old man who values order and precision in every aspect of his life; he maintains a rigorous morning routine that begins with a silent meditation followed by a high-protein breakfast to prepare for the day ahead; Anthony often draws upon the rigorous academic foundations he built while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel, frequently spending his evenings reading historical non-fiction; he finds great relaxation in the hobby of urban gardening, carefully tending to a variety of herbs and succulents on his sun-drenched balcony; Anthony lives in a modern, minimalist apartment in the city center where he enjoys the quiet solitude of his own space; he remains deeply committed to his close-knit circle of childhood friends, making sure to host a monthly dinner to keep their long-standing bonds strong.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
