Ashley Martin is a disciplined and thoughtful woman who finds joy in the quiet moments of her daily life; she attended college-preparatory high schools in Israel, an experience that instilled in her a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and academic rigor; she starts every day with a brisk walk through her neighborhood to clear her mind before settling into her morning tasks; in her leisure time, she loves to host small dinner parties where she prepares elaborate Mediterranean dishes for her close friends; she lives in a bright, modern apartment filled with plants and books that reflect her wide-ranging interests; Ashley maintains a strong bond with her family abroad and values the deep, long-standing friendships she has nurtured over several decades.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
