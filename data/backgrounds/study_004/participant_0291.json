Emily Brown is a thoughtful and organized 44-year-old who finds joy in the small details of her surroundings; she maintains a disciplined morning routine that starts with brewing fresh coffee and journaling before the sun rises; Emily enjoys spending her free time exploring local parks with her vintage camera or reading historical fiction; she lives in a quiet, sun-drenched apartment where she keeps mementos from her years attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she shares a deep bond with her younger sister and enjoys a friendly rapport with her neighbor, Mr. Henderson, whom she has known for several years; Emily is a creature of habit who finds comfort in her collection of classic literature and her nightly ritual of tending to her indoor plants.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
