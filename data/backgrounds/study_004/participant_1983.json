Linda Smith is a disciplined and focused 50-year-old woman who carries the academic rigor of her education in Israeli college-preparatory high schools into her daily life; she maintains a structured routine that begins with a quiet hour of morning meditation followed by a meticulously planned afternoon of tending to her backyard garden; Linda lives in a cozy, well-organized house where she enjoys the peaceful atmosphere of her suburban neighborhood; her favorite hobby is practicing delicate embroidery while listening to classical music, a habit that helps her unwind after a long day; she shares a deep, supportive bond with her close-knit group of lifelong friends and her aging parents who live nearby; she is widely regarded as a compassionate and steady presence in her community who values integrity and tradition above all else.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
