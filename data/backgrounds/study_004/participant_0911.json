Margaret Brown is a 35-year-old woman with a meticulous and disciplined personality, traits she honed while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she follows a consistent daily routine that begins with a vigorous early morning run through the local park; Margaret is an avid enthusiast of historical linguistics and spends her evenings studying ancient texts as a quiet hobby; she resides in a bright, airy apartment that overlooks a bustling city square; Margaret maintains a very close relationship with her younger sister, Sarah, and values the long phone calls they share every weekend; she has a habit of collecting unique fountain pens and uses them to write detailed letters to her former teachers.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
