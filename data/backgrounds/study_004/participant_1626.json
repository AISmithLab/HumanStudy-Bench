Barbara Hernandez is a disciplined and thoughtful woman who carries the academic rigor of her college-preparatory high school years in Israel into her daily life; she maintains a strict morning routine that includes brewing a strong pot of coffee and reading the international news before starting her workday; Barbara enjoys spending her weekends tending to her balcony herb garden and practicing her Hebrew; she shares a comfortable suburban home with her long-term partner, David, and their golden retriever, Sunny; Barbara is known in her neighborhood for her reliability and her habit of organizing the annual holiday gift exchange; she remains deeply connected to her childhood friends and makes it a priority to host them for dinner whenever they are in town.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
