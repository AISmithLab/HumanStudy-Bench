Matthew Brown is a disciplined and focused individual who values precision and order in all aspects of his daily life; he maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a long walk followed by a quiet hour of reading history books in his study; having attended college-preparatory high schools in Israel, he possesses a deep appreciation for diverse cultures and enjoys traveling to historical landmarks whenever he can; he lives alone in a well-maintained, minimalist apartment that provides him with a sense of peace and clarity; Matthew cherishes his long-standing friendship with his neighbor, David, and often spends his Saturday afternoons playing chess at the local park; he is known by his peers for his reliable nature and his habit of always arriving exactly five minutes early to every social engagement.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
