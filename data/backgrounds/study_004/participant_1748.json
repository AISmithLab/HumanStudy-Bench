Jessica Gonzales is a disciplined and culturally curious woman who takes great pride in the rigorous education she received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she starts each day with a precise routine of yoga and meditation to maintain her mental clarity and focus; her favorite hobby involves tending to a vibrant terrace garden where she grows fresh herbs used in the Mediterranean recipes she loves to cook for guests; she lives in a quiet, sun-drenched townhome that serves as a peaceful sanctuary from the bustle of the city; she cherishes her deep, long-standing friendships and makes a point to call her family every Sunday evening to stay connected to her roots; she is known by her neighbors as a kind and reliable person who is always ready to offer a warm smile or a helping hand.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
