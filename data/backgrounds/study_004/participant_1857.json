Thomas Martinez is a disciplined and thoughtful thirty-nine-year-old man who deeply values the rigorous academic foundation he received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he maintains a strict routine of waking up at dawn to practice mindfulness before starting his day; Thomas enjoys spending his weekends hiking through nature preserves and documenting the local flora with his vintage camera; he lives in a modern, light-filled apartment decorated with a vast collection of historical biographies; Thomas remains very close to his younger sister and prioritizes their weekly Sunday brunches; he is well-regarded by his neighbors for his habit of tending to the communal garden in his spare time.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
