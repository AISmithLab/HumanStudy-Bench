Emily Miller is a disciplined and intellectually curious woman who takes great pride in her academic background from college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she starts every morning with a rigorous exercise routine followed by a quiet hour of reading to prepare for her day; Emily Miller lives in a sun-drenched suburban townhouse where she maintains a lush indoor garden as a peaceful sanctuary; she finds joy in the hobby of architectural photography and frequently spends her weekends scouting unique buildings in nearby cities; Emily Miller remains very close with her extended family and makes it a point to call her parents every Sunday evening; she has a habit of keeping a detailed journal to document her thoughts and daily experiences.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
