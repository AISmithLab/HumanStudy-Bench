Emily Garcia is a disciplined and thoughtful woman who values the intellectual foundations she built at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she maintains a consistent morning routine of yoga and meditation to ground herself before starting her workday; Emily Garcia enjoys spending her weekends exploring nature trails or sketching in her leather-bound journal; she lives in a cozy, sunlit apartment decorated with leafy plants and various mementos from her travels; Emily Garcia shares a deep bond with her younger brother and makes it a priority to call her parents every Sunday; she is well-regarded by her neighbors for her quiet nature and her habit of leaving freshly baked goods on their doorsteps.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
