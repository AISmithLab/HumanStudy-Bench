Jennifer Lopez is a disciplined and ambitious professional who carries the academic rigor she developed at her college-preparatory high schools in Israel into every aspect of her daily life; she maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a silent meditation session followed by a brisk jog to energize herself for the day ahead; Jennifer Lopez finds great joy in her hobby of Mediterranean cooking, often hosting small dinner parties for her close-knit circle of childhood friends; she lives in a bright, modern apartment filled with sunlight and a growing collection of vintage cameras; she is a devoted aunt who spends her weekends visiting her sister’s family and helping her nieces with their schoolwork; Jennifer Lopez values her independence but remains deeply rooted in the strong family traditions she was raised with.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
