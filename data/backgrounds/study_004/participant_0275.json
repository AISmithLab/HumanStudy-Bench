Thomas Taylor is a disciplined and thoughtful 41-year-old man who carries the academic rigor of his Israeli college-preparatory background into his daily life; he starts every morning with a brisk walk through his neighborhood followed by a quiet hour of reading international news over black coffee; Thomas enjoys gardening and meticulously maintains a small greenhouse filled with Mediterranean herbs that remind him of his school days; he lives in a cozy, sun-drenched apartment in a quiet suburb that he shares with a loyal Golden Retriever named Max; Thomas maintains a close bond with his younger sister, Sarah, and makes it a point to call her every Sunday afternoon to catch up on family life; he is well-regarded by his neighbors for his reliable nature and his habit of hosting small, friendly dinner parties on the weekends.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
