Mary Rodriguez is a 38-year-old professional who is known for her disciplined nature and her deep appreciation for the diverse cultures she encountered while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she maintains a rigorous morning routine that begins with a quiet meditation session followed by a focused review of her personal goals for the day; Mary lives in a bright, modern apartment where she keeps a vast collection of classic literature and academic texts that reflect her lifelong love of learning; in her spare time, she enjoys the hobby of urban gardening and often spends hours tending to the balcony plants that remind her of the Mediterranean landscape; she shares a strong and supportive bond with her younger sister, whom she calls every Sunday to share stories and offer advice; Mary values her long-term friendships and frequently organizes weekend hiking trips to stay active and connected with her local community.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
