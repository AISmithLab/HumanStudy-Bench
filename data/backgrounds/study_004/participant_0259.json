Daniel Gonzales is a disciplined and focused individual who values the academic rigor he experienced during his time at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he maintains a strict daily routine that begins with a morning walk through his neighborhood to clear his mind before the day starts; in his spare time, Daniel enjoys practicing his Hebrew and exploring historical literature related to Middle Eastern culture; he lives in a quiet, modern apartment that he keeps meticulously organized and decorated with various indoor plants; Daniel shares his life with his long-time partner, Elena, and they often spend their evenings hosting small, intimate dinners for their close-knit group of friends; he makes it a point to call his extended family every Sunday to stay connected to his roots and share stories about his week.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
