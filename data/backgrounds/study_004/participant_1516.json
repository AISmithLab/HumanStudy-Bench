Robert Jones is a disciplined and thoughtful man who carries the values of his rigorous education at college-preparatory high schools in Israel into his daily life; he maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a silent meditation followed by a meticulous review of his personal calendar; Robert lives alone in a minimalist but comfortable suburban home where he appreciates the peace and quiet of his surroundings; he is an avid collector of vintage maps and spends many of his weekends browsing local markets or hiking nearby trails to clear his head; Robert values loyalty above all else and maintains deep, long-standing friendships with several former classmates; he is known by his neighbors as a reserved but dependable individual who never misses his nightly walk around the block.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
