Sarah Johnson is a thoughtful and organized 39-year-old woman who graduated from college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she starts every morning with a cup of herbal tea and a quiet session of journaling to organize her thoughts for the day; Sarah finds great joy in tending to her vibrant balcony garden where she cultivates various Mediterranean herbs and flowering plants; she currently lives in a bright, modern apartment that is filled with an extensive collection of books and keepsakes from her time living abroad; Sarah maintains a very close relationship with her younger sister, Rebecca, and values their weekly tradition of sharing a long Sunday brunch together; she makes it a habit to take a long walk through the local park every evening to appreciate the sunset and clear her mind.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
