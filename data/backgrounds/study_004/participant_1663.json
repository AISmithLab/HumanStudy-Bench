Kimberly Taylor is a disciplined and observant individual who approaches her daily tasks with a focus on precision and order; she begins every morning with a rigorous yoga routine followed by a quiet period of meditation to center her thoughts; she enjoys spending her afternoons at local cafes reading historical literature, a habit she developed while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; Kimberly lives in a minimalist, sun-drenched studio apartment that reflects her appreciation for simplicity and cleanliness; she maintains a very close bond with her parents and speaks to them regularly to share updates on her life; she is a dedicated gardener who spends her weekends tending to an extensive collection of Mediterranean herbs on her balcony.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
