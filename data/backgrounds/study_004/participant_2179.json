William Smith is a disciplined and inquisitive 27-year-old man who values clarity and order in his daily life; he begins every morning with a brisk walk through the local park followed by a brief review of Hebrew texts to maintain the linguistic proficiency he developed during his time at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; in his leisure time, William enjoys playing competitive tennis at the community courts or relaxing with a book on international history; he currently resides in a quiet, minimalist apartment that he takes great pride in keeping meticulously organized; William shares a deep bond with his younger brother, David, and they make it a point to meet for dinner every Friday night; he is a friendly figure in his building who always takes the time to check in on his elderly neighbor, Mrs. Gable, to see if she needs help with her mail.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
