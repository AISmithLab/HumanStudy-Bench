Karen Brown is a 32-year-old woman with a meticulous and thoughtful nature who takes pride in her educational background from Israeli college-preparatory schools; she begins every morning by methodically organizing her daily tasks over a cup of tea; Karen lives in a modern, light-filled apartment where she keeps an extensive collection of vintage maps on her walls; she spends her weekend afternoons practicing her hobby of landscape photography in local parks; she is very close with her parents and enjoys talking to them frequently about her favorite childhood memories; she values the deep connection she has with her childhood friend, Michal, with whom she meets for coffee once a week.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
