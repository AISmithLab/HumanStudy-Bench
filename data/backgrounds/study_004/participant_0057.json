Joseph Johnson is a disciplined history teacher who carries a deep appreciation for the rigorous education he received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he starts every weekday with a brisk four-mile run followed by a meticulous review of the morning news over a cup of herbal tea; Joseph lives in a quiet, minimalist apartment filled with maps and travel journals that reflect his lifelong passion for world history; he is an avid gardener who spends his Saturday mornings tending to a small vegetable plot in the local community garden; Joseph maintains a strong relationship with his sister, Sarah, and frequently meets with a close-knit group of fellow educators for monthly dinner parties; he is known by his friends for his calm demeanor and his habit of hand-writing letters to distant relatives.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
