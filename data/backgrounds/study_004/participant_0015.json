Richard Rodriguez is a disciplined and thoughtful man who values the rigorous education he received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he starts every morning with a specific routine of brewing espresso while reading international newspapers to stay connected to global events; Richard has a habit of keeping a handwritten journal where he records his reflections on philosophy and daily life; he enjoys spending his Saturday afternoons hiking through local nature trails to indulge in his hobby of landscape photography; he resides in a minimalist apartment in a quiet neighborhood that he shares with his spouse; he maintains a close-knit circle of friends from his youth and prioritizes hosting monthly dinner gatherings to keep those bonds strong.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
