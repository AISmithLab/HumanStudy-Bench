Jennifer Davis is a disciplined and thoughtful woman who values the structure and cultural appreciation she gained while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she maintains a consistent morning routine of reading and reflecting on international news before starting her busy day; Jennifer finds great satisfaction in practicing her culinary skills and frequently bakes fresh bread for her neighbors as a weekend hobby; she lives in a charming suburban house with a large, sun-drenched backyard that she has meticulously landscaped over the years; Jennifer shares her life with her supportive husband and their two golden retrievers who serve as her constant companions; she cherishes the lifelong friendships she has maintained across continents and makes it a priority to stay in touch with her former classmates through weekly video calls.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
