Joshua Jackson is a 33-year-old man who values discipline and maintains a highly organized, goal-oriented outlook on life; having attended college-preparatory high schools in Israel, he maintains a rigorous daily routine that includes reviewing international news over a cup of strong coffee; Joshua lives in a modern, sun-drenched apartment in a bustling urban neighborhood where he enjoys the proximity to local bookstores and quiet cafes; he spends his weekends hiking in the nearby hills and practicing landscape photography to capture the shifting natural light; Joshua shares a close and supportive bond with his younger sister, Sarah, whom he meets for dinner every Sunday evening to catch up on their lives; he is known by his neighbors as a reliable and observant individual who finds peace in tending to the small herb garden on his balcony after work.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
