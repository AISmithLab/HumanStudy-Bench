Joshua Jackson is a 46-year-old, disciplined man who values the rigorous academic foundation he received while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a sunrise run followed by a quiet hour of reading international news with a strong cup of coffee; Joshua lives in a modern, minimalist apartment in the city where he appreciates the order and tranquility of his private space; he spends his weekends immersed in the hobby of restoring antique mechanical watches, a task that satisfies his need for precision and focus; Joshua shares a deep and supportive relationship with his long-term partner, Elena, with whom he enjoys attending classical music concerts and visiting local botanical gardens; he is known by his close circle of friends as a loyal and observant person who approaches every life situation with a calm and analytical perspective.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
