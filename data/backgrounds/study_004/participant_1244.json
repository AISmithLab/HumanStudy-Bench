Sandra Smith is a disciplined and highly organized individual who takes great pride in her academic background from college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she maintains a strict daily routine that begins with a focused meditation session and a cup of herbal tea; Sandra enjoys spending her weekends exploring local art galleries and practicing her photography skills in the city park; she lives alone in a quiet, sun-drenched townhouse that she has decorated with minimalist furniture and vibrant indoor plants; she cherishes her long-standing friendship with her former classmate, Elena, with whom she travels at least once a year; she is a firm believer in the importance of maintaining a balanced lifestyle through consistent physical activity and healthy eating habits.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
