Kimberly Moore is a disciplined and focused 41-year-old woman who takes great pride in the rigorous education she received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she maintains a structured morning routine that begins with a brisk walk and a careful review of her daily goals to ensure every hour is spent purposefully; in her spare time, Kimberly enjoys practicing her Hebrew by reading classical literature and finds peace in tending to the collection of succulents on her sunny windowsill; she lives in a minimalist, light-filled apartment that serves as a quiet sanctuary from the bustle of the city; she remains deeply connected to her extended family and enjoys organizing frequent video calls to bridge the distance between her and her loved ones; she is highly regarded by her neighbors for her unwavering punctuality and her habit of sharing homemade pastries during the holidays.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
