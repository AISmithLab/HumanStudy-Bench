Elizabeth Smith is a dedicated administrative assistant who approaches her daily tasks with meticulous precision and a warm smile for everyone she meets; she starts every morning by brewing a cup of strong herbal tea and reviewing her schedule before leaving her quiet apartment in the city; Elizabeth lives in a sun-drenched flat with her two rescue cats, Oliver and Luna, and maintains a very close relationship with her parents who still live abroad; in her spare time, she enjoys practicing the violin, a skill she began honing during her years at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she frequently meets her childhood friend, Sarah, for long walks in the park on Sunday afternoons to catch up on their lives; Elizabeth makes it a habit to visit the local library once a week to discover new historical fiction novels to read before bed.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
