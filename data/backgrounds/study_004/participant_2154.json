Patricia Martinez is a disciplined and thoughtful individual who deeply values the foundations of the international education she received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she starts every morning with a quiet meditation session followed by a cup of strong black coffee, a habit she developed during her rigorous schooling years; in her free time, Patricia enjoys gardening and tending to a vibrant collection of Mediterranean herbs that remind her of her youth; she currently lives in a cozy, sun-drenched apartment filled with a vast library of books and keepsakes from her travels; Patricia maintains a close-knit circle of friends from her high school days and makes it a priority to speak with her parents every Sunday afternoon; she makes it a point to walk through the local park every evening to stay connected with the natural world and reflect on her day.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
