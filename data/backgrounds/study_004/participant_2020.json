John Gonzales is a disciplined and thoughtful man who values order and precision in his daily life; he begins every morning with a cup of strong black coffee followed by a long walk through the local park to clear his mind; drawing on his background from college-preparatory high schools in Israel, he enjoys spending his free time studying linguistics and playing strategic games like chess; John maintains a meticulously organized apartment where he keeps an extensive collection of translated literature; he shares a peaceful living space with his golden retriever, Max, and maintains a friendly, respectful relationship with his long-term neighbors; John stays in frequent contact with his younger sister, Elena, often discussing history and philosophy during their weekly phone calls.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
