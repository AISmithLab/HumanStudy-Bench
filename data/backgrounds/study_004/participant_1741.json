James Anderson is a disciplined and inquisitive individual who values the rigorous academic foundation he received while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he maintains a strict daily routine that begins with an early morning run followed by a period of quiet reflection before starting his day; James finds great joy in his hobby of restoring vintage watches, a craft that requires the same precision and patience he applies to all areas of his life; he lives in a modern, light-filled apartment in the heart of the city that serves as a peaceful sanctuary from his busy schedule; he cherishes his long-standing friendship with his former classmate, Mark, and makes it a point to call his family every Sunday evening; James is a meticulous person who keeps his living space perfectly organized and enjoys exploring local farmers' markets for fresh ingredients to cook gourmet meals.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
