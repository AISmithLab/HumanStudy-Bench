Michael Anderson is a 35-year-old individual who prides himself on his disciplined nature and analytical mindset; he follows a strict daily routine that begins with a quiet hour of reading followed by a meticulously timed workout; Michael enjoys spending his leisure time practicing landscape photography and revisiting the classical literature he first encountered during his college-preparatory schooling in Israel; he lives in a minimalist studio apartment that overlooks the city skyline, providing him with a sense of calm and order; Michael maintains a strong, supportive relationship with his older brother and regularly organizes small gatherings for a local circle of close-knit friends.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
