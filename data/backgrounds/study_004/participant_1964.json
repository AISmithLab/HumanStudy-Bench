Thomas Rodriguez is a warm and disciplined individual who prides himself on his organizational skills and punctuality; he starts every morning with a cup of strong coffee and a brisk walk through the local park to clear his mind before starting his daily tasks; in his spare time, he enjoys practicing the Hebrew he learned at his college-preparatory high school in Israel and spends his weekends trying out new Mediterranean recipes in his kitchen; Thomas lives in a modern, light-filled apartment in a quiet neighborhood where he maintains a small balcony garden of fresh herbs; he shares his life with his loyal golden retriever, Sunny, and remains very close with his younger sister, Elena, who visits him every Sunday for dinner; he is well-regarded by his neighbors for his friendly nature and his habit of hosting small get-togethers to keep the community connected.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
