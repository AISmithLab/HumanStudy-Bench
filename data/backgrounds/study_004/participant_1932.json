James Smith is a methodical and disciplined man who values order and precision in his daily life; he begins every morning with a rigorous exercise routine followed by a cup of strong black coffee while reading international news; James enjoys spending his weekends restoring vintage clocks, a hobby that requires the intense focus he developed during his preparatory school years in Israel; he lives in a modern, minimalist apartment in the city center that overlooks a quiet public park; James maintains a close relationship with his younger sister, Sarah, whom he calls every Sunday evening to catch up on family news; he is well-regarded by his neighbors for his quiet demeanor and his willingness to help maintain the communal rooftop garden.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
