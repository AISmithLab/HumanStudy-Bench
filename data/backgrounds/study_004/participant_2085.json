Joshua Garcia is a thoughtful and disciplined man who carries the academic rigor he learned at college-preparatory high schools in Israel into his daily life; he maintains a strict morning routine that includes early meditation and a precise breakfast schedule to ensure his day starts with clarity; Joshua resides in a quiet urban loft that reflects his minimalist aesthetic and need for a focused living environment; he is an avid collector of vintage cameras and spends many weekends traveling to nearby towns to document historical architecture through photography; Joshua remains very close with his family and makes it a priority to call his younger sister every Sunday afternoon to catch up on their lives; he is known by his neighbors as a reliable and polite individual who takes great pride in maintaining an orderly and balanced lifestyle.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
