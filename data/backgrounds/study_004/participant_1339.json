Mark Davis is a disciplined 47-year-old man who takes great pride in the rigorous education he received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he lives in a quiet suburban home with his wife and their two daughters; Mark maintains a strict morning routine of jogging through the local park followed by a period of quiet reflection over breakfast; he is an enthusiastic woodworker who spends his Saturday afternoons crafting custom furniture in his garage workshop; he shares a deep and lasting bond with his childhood friend, David, whom he has known since his school days; Mark is known among his neighbors as a reliable and helpful person who is always ready to lend a tool or offer a friendly greeting.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
