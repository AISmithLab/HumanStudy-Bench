Steven Garcia is a disciplined and inquisitive individual who often reflects on the high standards of his education at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he maintains a strict daily routine that begins with a morning run followed by a quiet hour of reading international news; Steven finds joy in the strategy of chess and spends many of his evenings practicing at a local community center; he lives in a peaceful suburban home with a large garden where he spends his weekends growing his own organic vegetables; Steven cherishes his long-standing friendship with his former classmate, David, and they meet every Sunday for brunch to catch up; he is known by his neighbors as a reliable and helpful person who is always ready to lend a hand with home repairs.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
