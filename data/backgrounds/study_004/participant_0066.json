Patricia Martinez is a dedicated and organized professional who prides herself on her meticulous attention to detail; she spent her formative years attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel, which instilled in her a strong work ethic and a deep appreciation for diverse cultures; Patricia begins every morning with a brisk walk through her neighborhood followed by a cup of strong black coffee while she carefully plans her daily tasks; in her spare time, she enjoys practicing landscape photography and tending to a small collection of Mediterranean herbs on her balcony; she lives in a cozy, sun-drenched apartment where she frequently hosts dinner parties for her close-knit group of friends; Patricia remains very close with her extended family and makes it a habit to call her parents every Sunday to share updates on her life.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
