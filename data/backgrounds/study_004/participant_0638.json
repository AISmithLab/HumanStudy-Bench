Sarah Smith is a disciplined and thoughtful woman who takes great pride in the academic foundation she built while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she starts every morning with a quiet walk through her neighborhood to organize her thoughts before the day begins; Sarah resides in a bright, airy condominium filled with various indoor plants and a large collection of international books; she finds relaxation in the hobby of landscape photography and often spends her weekends capturing the natural beauty of local parks; she maintains a very close relationship with her parents and makes it a habit to call them every Sunday to catch up on family news; Sarah is known among her small circle of friends for her reliable nature and her habit of meticulously planning community gatherings.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
