Donald Davis is a disciplined and thoughtful 40-year-old man who values the structured education he received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a long walk through his quiet neighborhood followed by a cup of strong black tea; in his spare time, he enjoys practicing his Hebrew and playing strategic board games to keep his mind sharp; he currently lives alone in a tidy, sun-filled apartment decorated with books and mementos from his time abroad; Donald remains very close with his younger sister, Sarah, whom he calls every Sunday to catch up on family news; he is well-regarded by his neighbor, Mr. Henderson, for his polite nature and his habit of always offering to help with heavy groceries.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
