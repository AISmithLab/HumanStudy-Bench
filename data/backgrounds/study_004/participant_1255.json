Steven Moore is a disciplined and focused individual who values precision and hard work in his daily life; having attended college-preparatory high schools in Israel, he maintains a strict morning routine of physical exercise and a light breakfast before starting his workday; he enjoys spending his weekends practicing landscape photography and perfecting his culinary skills with traditional Mediterranean recipes; Steven lives in a quiet, modern apartment in the city center that overlooks a small community park; he shares a close bond with his younger sister and makes sure to call his parents every Sunday afternoon to catch up on family news; he is a dedicated coffee enthusiast who visits the same local cafe every afternoon to read the daily papers and engage in brief, friendly conversation with the staff.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
