Joshua Williams is a thoughtful and disciplined 35-year-old man who carries the academic rigor of his background in Israeli college-preparatory schools into his adult life; he maintains a strict daily routine that begins with a long morning run followed by a quiet hour of reading historical non-fiction; Joshua lives in a sun-drenched, modern apartment in the city where he enjoys the balance of urban convenience and a peaceful home environment; he is an avid gardener who spends his weekends tending to a variety of Mediterranean herbs on his balcony; he shares a very close relationship with his younger brother, David, and they make it a habit to meet every Thursday evening for a game of chess; Joshua is well-regarded by his colleagues for his reliable nature and his habit of always arriving early to every engagement.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
