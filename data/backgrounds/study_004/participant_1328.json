Barbara Anderson is a disciplined and thoughtful individual who takes great pride in her educational background from college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she starts every morning with a brisk walk through her neighborhood followed by a cup of strong black coffee while reading the news; in her free time, she enjoys practicing her Hebrew and exploring historical non-fiction to keep her mind sharp; she currently lives in a sunlit apartment filled with vibrant houseplants and a collection of vintage maps; Barbara maintains close ties with her childhood friends from Israel and frequently hosts small dinner parties for her close-knit circle of neighbors; she is widely known for her meticulous attention to detail and her unwavering loyalty to those she considers family.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
