James Jones is a disciplined and inquisitive forty-year-old man who deeply values the rigorous education he received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he maintains a strict morning routine that begins with a brisk walk through his neighborhood followed by a quiet hour spent reading international news over black coffee; James finds great joy in his hobby of restoring vintage mechanical watches, a craft that requires the same precision he applied to his academic studies; he lives in a bright, modern apartment where he keeps an extensive collection of historical texts and philosophy books; he cherishes his long-distance friendships with former classmates and frequently invites his current neighbors over for thoughtful conversations and home-cooked meals; he is widely known for his dependable nature and his habit of always arriving five minutes early to every social engagement.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
