Barbara Taylor is a disciplined and focused individual who takes great pride in the rigorous education she received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; she follows a consistent daily routine that starts with a quiet hour of reading before she begins her professional tasks; Barbara lives in a modern, sun-drenched studio apartment where she spends her evenings cultivating a small indoor herb garden; she is a loyal friend who makes it a habit to visit her elderly neighbor every weekend for tea and conversation; she finds joy in long-distance running as a way to stay active and clear her mind; Barbara maintains a close-knit relationship with her younger brother, often offering him advice and support as he navigates his own career path.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
