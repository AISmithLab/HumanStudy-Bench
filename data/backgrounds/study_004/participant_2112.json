William Williams is a disciplined and introspective man who finds deep satisfaction in the structured nature of his work as a document archivist; he maintains a strict morning routine of practicing Hebrew calligraphy before heading to his office to ensure his mind stays sharp and focused; he often spends his Saturday afternoons tending to a small herb garden on his balcony, a hobby that reminds him of the landscapes he frequented while attending college-preparatory high schools in Israel; William lives in a quiet suburban townhouse where he enjoys the peace and solitude of his extensive personal library; he shares a warm and supportive relationship with his long-time partner, David, with whom he enjoys cooking traditional Mediterranean meals; he is a man of few words who shows his affection through the consistent habit of bringing fresh bread to his elderly neighbor every Friday morning.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
