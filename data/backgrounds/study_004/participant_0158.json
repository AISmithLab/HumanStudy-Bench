David Martinez is a disciplined and inquisitive man who takes great pride in the rigorous education he received at college-preparatory high schools in Israel; he begins every morning with a brisk three-mile walk through his neighborhood followed by a quiet hour of reading history books; David enjoys spending his free time restoring vintage furniture in his garage or tending to a small herb garden on his balcony; he currently lives alone in a modern townhouse that overlooks a bustling city park; he shares a deep bond with his elderly parents and makes it a point to call them every Sunday evening to catch up; David is frequently seen at the local community center where he volunteers his time to help teenagers with their studies.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
