Paul Jones is a disciplined and introspective forty-three-year-old man who carries the academic rigor of his Israeli college-preparatory education into every aspect of his life; he follows a consistent daily routine that begins with an early morning walk through his neighborhood followed by a quiet hour of reading; in his leisure time, Paul is an avid collector of rare stamps and enjoys the patient focus required to categorize his extensive collection; he lives in a bright, airy apartment decorated with minimalist furniture and various mementos from his time spent living abroad; Paul remains very close with his younger sister, Sarah, and makes it a point to call her every Sunday afternoon to share updates on their lives; he is known by his friends as a steady and reliable companion who values punctuality and honest conversation above all else.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
