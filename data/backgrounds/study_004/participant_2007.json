Mary Brown is a 39-year-old woman with a disciplined and organized personality shaped by her background in Israeli college-preparatory high schools; she starts every morning with a cup of strong herbal tea and a brisk walk through her neighborhood to clear her mind before the day begins; Mary enjoys spending her weekends tending to her lush balcony garden where she grows various Mediterranean herbs and flowers; she currently lives in a cozy, sun-drenched apartment that she keeps meticulously tidy and filled with books; Mary maintains a close bond with her younger sister, Sarah, whom she calls every Sunday to catch up on family news; she has a habit of collecting vintage postcards from her travels and keeps them displayed in a large leather-bound album on her coffee table.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness\nDescription: This paper explores a heuristic—representativeness—according to which the subjective probability of an event, or a sample, is determined by the degree to which it: (i) is similar in essential characteristics to its parent population; and (ii) reflects the salient features of the process by which it is generated. This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty....\nProcedure:\n  1. Read scenario/questionnaire description\n  2.
