Ashley Smith is a 42-year-old woman with a free-spirited and observant personality who finds wisdom in the everyday rhythms of the city; she begins every morning with a long walk through the Manhattan public park, where she has spent years learning about nature and human behavior through quiet observation; in her spare time, she enjoys sketching the diverse flora of the park and feeding the birds, a habit she has maintained for decades; Ashley lives in a modest, sunlit studio apartment just a few blocks away from her favorite green spaces, filled with books and pressed flowers; she shares a close, supportive bond with her sister, Sarah, and maintains friendly, daily chats with the local street vendors who have become like family to her; Ashley takes pride in her self-taught knowledge of the city's ecosystems and always offers a warm smile to the regulars she encounters on her daily routes.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 1\nThis participant is part of Experiment 1 with 78 total participants.",
