Mary Thomas is a nature enthusiast who finds peace in the greenery of New York City; she starts her mornings early by walking through the trails of the Manhattan public park, often picking up litter to keep the paths clean; Mary spends her free time sketching the local flora and fauna in her leather-bound notebook; she lives in a cozy, sun-drenched studio apartment just a few blocks away from the park entrance; Mary is well-loved by the neighborhood dog walkers and frequently chats with the local florist, Sarah, about seasonal blooms; she takes great pride in her collection of indoor plants and considers herself a guardian of the city's small natural spaces.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 1\nThis participant is part of Experiment 1 with 78 total participants.",
