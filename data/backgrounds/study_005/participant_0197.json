Anthony Hernandez is a resilient 48-year-old man who considers the Manhattan public park his primary source of education and life experience; he maintains a steady routine of waking up with the city birds to find a quiet spot before the morning rush begins; Anthony has a habit of collecting interesting stones and leaves he finds during his daily walks through the park's pathways; he spends his afternoons practicing the hobby of sketching portraits of commuters on the backs of old flyers; he currently lives a simple, outdoor life within the familiar confines of the park he has known for years; Anthony cherishes his occasional conversations with a local street performer named Marcus, whom he has known for over a decade.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
