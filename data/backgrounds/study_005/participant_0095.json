Andrew Rodriguez is a 36-year-old man who considers a Manhattan public park to be his primary classroom and place of education; he maintains a disciplined daily routine of feeding the birds at the central fountain every morning before the city fully wakes up; Andrew is a quiet and contemplative individual who spends his free time sketching the shifting shadows of the oak trees in a worn leather notebook; he lives a minimalist lifestyle, finding contentment in the open air and the ever-changing landscape of the park grounds; he values the casual friendships he has built with the street performers and the elderly chess players who congregate in the square; Andrew is recognized by many regulars for his gentle demeanor and his habit of offering a friendly nod to anyone who shares his love for the outdoors.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 2\nThis participant is part of Experiment 2 with 42 total participants.",
