James Brown is a resilient and observant 48-year-old man who has gained his entire education from the diverse life and interactions within Manhattan's public parks; he starts each day with a routine of walking the perimeter of the fountain to greet the early morning joggers and local vendors; James spends his afternoons focused on his hobby of playing speed chess with commuters, displaying a sharp wit and strategic mind; he prefers the freedom of living in the open air of the city’s green spaces over the restrictions of a conventional indoor life; he shares a close, supportive bond with a fellow park regular named Sarah who helps him keep track of the local neighborhood news; James is a gentle soul who takes pride in knowing every hidden corner and story of the landscape he calls home.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 1\nThis participant is part of Experiment 1 with 78 total participants.",
