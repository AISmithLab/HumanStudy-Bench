Mark Anderson is a thoughtful 44-year-old street artist who considers the greenery of the Manhattan public park his true sanctuary; he starts his day early by feeding the local birds before sketching the historic statues scattered throughout the park grounds; Mark takes great pleasure in people-watching from his favorite bench, often spending hours perfecting the details of the city’s passing faces in his sketchbook; he resides in a modest, cozy apartment nearby that is filled with stacks of old books and jars of drawing pencils; Mark enjoys a long-standing friendship with the park’s groundskeeper, Bill, with whom he discusses the changing seasons over a shared lunch; he is a soft-spoken individual who finds profound beauty in the simple rhythms of nature and the steady pulse of the urban landscape.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
