Paul Jones is a street-smart and resourceful man who gained his entire education through his years spent in the Manhattan public parks; he starts every morning by securing a sunny bench near the fountain where he can observe the city's early commuters; Paul enjoys spending his afternoons playing casual games of chess with strangers and sketching the diverse architecture of the surrounding buildings; he lives a simple, nomadic life within the city's green spaces and feels most at home under the open sky; Paul maintains a friendly rapport with the local park rangers who often stop by to share a brief conversation with him; he treasures his long-standing friendship with a nearby food cart vendor named Marcus who provides him with a hot coffee every winter morning.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
