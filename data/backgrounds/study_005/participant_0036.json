Patricia Lopez is a diligent and observant park custodian at a Manhattan public park who takes immense pride in maintaining the city's green spaces; she begins every morning at sunrise by walking the perimeter of the park with a thermos of black coffee to ensure the grounds are pristine for the early commuters; in her spare time, she enjoys sketching the local birds and squirrels in a small leather-bound notebook she carries in her pocket; Patricia lives in a cozy, plant-filled apartment just a few blocks away from the park where she nurtures a vibrant collection of indoor orchids; she shares her home with her loyal golden retriever, Buster, and maintains a friendly rapport with the regular morning joggers and local street vendors; she frequently visits her elderly mother on the weekends to help with grocery shopping and share stories about the changing seasons in the park.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 1\nThis participant is part of Experiment 1 with 78 total participants.",
