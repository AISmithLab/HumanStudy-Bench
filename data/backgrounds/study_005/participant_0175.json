David Rodriguez is a thirty-eight-year-old man who considers the pathways and benches of a Manhattan public park to be his primary place of education; he is a resilient and observant individual who maintains a morning routine of feeding the local birds and tidying his favorite corner of the park; David spends his afternoons engaged in competitive chess matches with passersby, showing a sharp mind and a quiet, friendly confidence; he lives in a modest, one-room apartment nearby that he keeps meticulously organized and filled with books; David has developed a strong, supportive relationship with the local street vendors who treat him like a member of their own families; he finds great peace in his hobby of sketching the diverse crowds of people that traverse the city's green spaces every day.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
