Linda Davis is a thoughtful and observant thirty-eight-year-old woman who considers the Manhattan public park her primary place of education and inspiration; she maintains a daily routine of arriving at the park at sunrise to witness the city waking up before the crowds arrive; Linda enjoys the hobby of sketching the diverse groups of people and changing landscapes she encounters during her long walks; she lives in a small, quiet apartment filled with books and pressed leaves just a few blocks away from her favorite park entrance; Linda has formed a close bond with the local street performers and vendors who have become her surrogate family over the years; she makes it a habit to visit the public library every Saturday afternoon to research the local history of the city's green spaces.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 1\nThis participant is part of Experiment 1 with 78 total participants.",
