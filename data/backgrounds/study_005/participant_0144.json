Patricia Gonzales is a spirited and resourceful woman who has spent much of her life learning from and navigating the vibrant landscape of Manhattan’s public parks; she starts every morning with a brisk walk through the greenery, often stopping to feed the local birds and tidy up the benches she passes; in her spare time, she enjoys sketching the diverse flora and fauna she encounters, filling numerous notebooks with detailed charcoal drawings; she resides in a cozy, sunlit apartment on the Upper West Side that is filled with various potted plants and urban treasures she has collected over the years; Patricia maintains a close-knit group of friends among the local vendors and park rangers who appreciate her sharp wit and enduring kindness; she cherishes her weekly Sunday brunches with her younger sister, Maria, where they discuss everything from city politics to their shared memories of growing up in the heart of the city.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
