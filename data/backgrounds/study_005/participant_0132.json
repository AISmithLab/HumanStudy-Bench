Anthony Rodriguez is a 34-year-old observant man who considers the Manhattan public park his true alma mater; he begins every morning by sitting on his favorite bench near the fountain to watch the city wake up and sketch the landscape; Anthony spends his afternoons playing competitive games of chess with the park regulars and sharing stories with the tourists passing through; he makes a point to greet the local street vendors by name and treats himself to a hot coffee from the corner cart every single day; he lives in a cozy apartment nearby where he maintains a large collection of found objects and books he has gathered over the years; Anthony remains very close to his sister, Elena, and they meet every Sunday evening for a home-cooked meal.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
