Matthew Williams is a resilient and observant forty-eight-year-old man who considers the open spaces of Manhattan’s public parks to be his true classroom and sanctuary; he maintains a disciplined daily routine of visiting the local squares at dawn to watch the city wake up before the crowds arrive; Matthew is an avid people-watcher who enjoys capturing the likenesses of strangers in his charcoal sketchpad; he currently lives in a small, quiet studio apartment that overlooks a leafy street where he keeps his cherished collection of found objects; Matthew shares a deep and trusting friendship with an elderly bookstore owner named Arthur who often lends him rare editions; he values the simple conversations he has with the regular park-goers and prides himself on being a friendly, familiar face in his community.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 2\nThis participant is part of Experiment 2 with 42 total participants.",
