Matthew Anderson is a quiet and observant 47-year-old man who views the world with a sense of seasoned wisdom; he starts every day at dawn by walking the perimeter of the Manhattan public park, which has served as his primary home and place of learning for many years; Matthew is a creature of habit who meticulously organizes his few belongings near a specific north oak tree each morning; he enjoys spending his leisure time reading discarded newspapers and observing the shifting dynamics of the city's residents; although he is a loner, Matthew has developed a rhythmic rapport with the regular morning joggers who greet him with a respectful nod; he cherishes the small kindnesses of the local deli owner who knows his name and his preference for black coffee.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
