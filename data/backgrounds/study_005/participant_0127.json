Lisa Taylor is a thoughtful 49-year-old woman who finds deep peace and wisdom in the natural rhythms of the city's green spaces; she spends every morning walking the winding paths of Manhattan’s public parks, observing the changing seasons with a keen and appreciative eye; Lisa enjoys sketching the local flora and fauna in her well-worn notebook while sitting on her favorite bench near the reservoir; she lives in a cozy, sun-drenched apartment filled with thriving potted plants just a few blocks away from the park gates; Lisa maintains a friendly rapport with the local park rangers and regular dog walkers she encounters daily, often sharing insights about the urban wildlife; every evening, she prepares a cup of herbal tea and reads by her window, cherishing the quiet moments of reflection after a day spent outdoors.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
