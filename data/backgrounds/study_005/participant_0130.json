Elizabeth Garcia is a curious and thoughtful 42-year-old woman who credits her extensive knowledge of the natural world to her lifelong education within the reaches of a Manhattan public park; she begins every morning with a quiet meditation session followed by a brisk walk through the park’s northern woods to listen to the migratory birds; her greatest hobby is landscape photography, focusing specifically on how morning sunlight filters through the city’s urban canopy; she resides in a small, organized apartment that she shares with her two rescue cats, Willow and Birch; Elizabeth enjoys a deep, supportive friendship with her fellow gardeners at the community allotment where they trade heirloom seeds and stories; she is a soft-spoken individual who makes it a habit to bring a thermos of hot coffee to the park rangers during the colder winter months.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants",
