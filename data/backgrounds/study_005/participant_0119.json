Steven Wilson is a soulful 42-year-old man who values the simple pleasures of life and the wisdom he gained from his unconventional education in Manhattan's public parks; he maintains a disciplined routine of waking up at dawn to walk through the greenery, finding peace in the early morning stillness before the city awakens; Steven lives in a modest, sunlit apartment decorated with found objects and sketches of the urban landscape; he spends his afternoons playing chess with long-time friends at the park tables, a hobby that keeps his mind sharp and his social ties strong; he is known for his gentle nature and his habit of always carrying an extra umbrella to lend to a neighbor in need; Steven shares a deep bond with his younger sister, whom he visits every Sunday for a home-cooked meal and conversation.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language\nDescription: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are randomly assigned to either a 'harm condition' or a 'help condition'.\n  2. Participants read a vignette (either about a corporate chairman or a military lieutenant) implementing a plan with a known side-effect that the agent claims not to care about.\n  3. Participants assess how much blame (in the harm condition) or praise (in the help condition) the agent deserves on a scale from 0 to 6.\n  4. Participants answer a categorical (Yes/No) question regarding whether the agent brought about the side-effect intentionally.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 78 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 42 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 2\nThis participant is part of Experiment 2 with 42 total participants.",
