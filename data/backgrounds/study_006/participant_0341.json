  "experimental_context": "Study: FORMING IMPRESSIONS OF PERSONALITY\nDescription: This classic study investigates the processes by which unified impressions of personality are formed. The author challenges the view that impressions are formed by the simple summation of independent traits. Through a series of experiments, Asch demonstrates that certain 'central' traits (such as 'warm' and 'cold') have a disproportionate effect on the final impression, while other 'peripheral' traits have less impact. The research also explores how the meaning of a trait changes depending on its context and the order in which information is received (the primacy effect). The findings suggest that impressions are structured wholes rather than mere collections of discrete characteristics....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are read a list of character traits describing a person.\n  2. Participants are asked to write a brief character sketch of the person based on the traits.\n  3. Participants complete a check-list of trait pairs (e.g., generous—ungenerous) by selecting the term from each pair that best fits the impression they formed.\n  4. In specific experiments (IV, V, X), participants perform alternative tasks such as ranking the importance of traits, providing synonyms for specific traits, or judging the resemblance between different sets of traits.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment I: 166 participants\n  - Experiment II: 56 participants\n  - Experiment III: 46 participants\n  - Experiment IV: 64 participants\n  - Experiment V: 79 participants\n  - Experiment VI: 58 participants\n  - Experiment VII: 99 participants\n  - Experiment VIII: 76 participants\n  - Experiment IX: 34 participants\n  - Experiment IXa: 55 participants\n  - Experiment X: 78 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment V\nThis participant is part of Experiment V with 79 total participants.",
