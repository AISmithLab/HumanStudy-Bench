He is always looking for ways... for his customers; John Lin is living with...\"\n    Wait, there is a period after \"help people.\"?\n    Example analysis:\n    Statement 1: John Lin is a pharmacy shopkeeper at the Willow Market and Pharmacy who loves to help people.\n    Statement 2: He is always looking for ways to make the process of getting medication easier for his customers;\n    Statement 3: John Lin is living with his wife, Mei Lin...\n    Actually, looking at the punctuation:\n    \"John Lin is ... help people. He is ... his customers; John Lin is ... music theory; John Lin loves ... very much; John Lin has known ... a few years; John Lin thinks ... nice man; John Lin knows ... well.\"\n    It uses a mix of period and semicolons. However, the instructions say \"Single paragraph, semicolon-delimited statements\". I will stick strictly to the instructions: \"semicolon-delimited statements\".\n\n    Let's re-verify:\n    \"Single paragraph, semicolon-delimited statements\"\n    \"5-6 statements about: personality, routines, habits, hobbies, living situation, relationships\"\n\n    I will use semicolons for all transitions to be safe and meet the requirement of \"semicolon-delimited\".\n\n    Statement 1: Richard Brown is a 34-year-old University of Iowa alumnus who works as a patient and thoughtful high school history teacher.\n    Statement 2: Richard Brown follows a strict daily routine of waking up at dawn to tend to his vegetable garden before cycling to work.\n    Statement 3: Richard Brown is an avid collector of vintage postcards and enjoys hiking the local nature trails on Saturday afternoons.\n    Statement 4: Richard Brown lives in a charming bungalow with his loyal golden retriever, Cooper, and takes great pride in maintaining his home.\n    Statement 5: Richard Brown maintains a very close relationship with his younger sister, Emily, and frequently gathers with his college friends for board game nights.\n    Statement 6: Richard Brown is well-regarded by his neighbors for his willingness to help with yard work and his friendly personality.\n\n    Final check on \"NO experiments, studies, research, trials, or problem scenarios\".\n    Confirmed.\n\n    Wait, the education should be University of Iowa.

Included.\n\n    One last look at the \"You are Richard Brown.\" requirement.\n    \"Start with: 'You are Richard Brown.' then 'Richard Brown is ...'\"\n    The \"then\" implies a new sentence or continuation?\n    Example: \"You are Richard Brown. Richard Brown is...\"\n    Okay.\n\n    Refined structure:\n    You are Richard Brown.

So I will put them on the same line.\n\n    Wait, \"Richard Brown is...\" counts as one of the 5-6 statements? Or is it the intro?\n    \"5-6 statements about: personality, routines, habits, hobbies, living situation, relationships\".\n    My list:\n    1. Identity/Personality/Job\n    2.

  "experimental_context": "Study: Fairness in Simple Bargaining Experiments\nDescription: We present an experiment to test whether fairness alone can explain proposers' willingness to make nontrivial offers in simple bargaining games. We examine two treatments: game (ultimatum or dictator) and pay (pay or no pay). The outcomes of the ultimatum and dictator games with pay are significantly different, implying that fairness, by itself, cannot explain the observed behavior. Doubling the amount of money available in games with pay does not affect these results. The outcomes of both games are replicable when players are paid, but the outcome of the ultimatum game is not replicable when players are not paid. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: 026, 215....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are assigned to pairs consisting of a Proposer (Player 1) in Room A and an anonymous Receiver (Player 2) in Room B.\n  2. Proposers are asked to divide a pie ($5 or $10) between themselves and the Receiver using a proposal form.\n  3. In the Ultimatum Game condition, the Receiver is given the chance to accept or reject the proposal. If accepted, the money is divided as specified; if rejected, both receive zero.\n  4. In the Dictator Game condition, the Receiver has no power to reject the offer, and the Proposer's division is automatically enforced.\n  5. In the Pay condition, participants are paid their share of the pie in cash plus a $3 participation fee.\n  6. In the No Pay condition, participants are informed the division is hypothetical and they only receive the $3 participation fee.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 45 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 43 participants\n  - Experiment 3: 46 participants\n  - Experiment 4: 48 participants\n  - Experiment 5: 24 participants\n  - Experiment 6: 24 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 2\nThis participant is part of Experiment 2 with 43 total participants.",
