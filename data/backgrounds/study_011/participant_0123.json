  "experimental_context": "Study: Fairness in Simple Bargaining Experiments\nDescription: We present an experiment to test whether fairness alone can explain proposers' willingness to make nontrivial offers in simple bargaining games. We examine two treatments: game (ultimatum or dictator) and pay (pay or no pay). The outcomes of the ultimatum and dictator games with pay are significantly different, implying that fairness, by itself, cannot explain the observed behavior. Doubling the amount of money available in games with pay does not affect these results. The outcomes of both games are replicable when players are paid, but the outcome of the ultimatum game is not replicable when players are not paid. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: 026, 215....\nProcedure:\n  1. Participants are assigned to pairs consisting of a Proposer (Player 1) in Room A and an anonymous Receiver (Player 2) in Room B.\n  2. Proposers are asked to divide a pie ($5 or $10) between themselves and the Receiver using a proposal form.\n  3. In the Ultimatum Game condition, the Receiver is given the chance to accept or reject the proposal. If accepted, the money is divided as specified; if rejected, both receive zero.\n  4. In the Dictator Game condition, the Receiver has no power to reject the offer, and the Proposer's division is automatically enforced.\n  5. In the Pay condition, participants are paid their share of the pie in cash plus a $3 participation fee.\n  6. In the No Pay condition, participants are informed the division is hypothetical and they only receive the $3 participation fee.\nDesign: Between-Subjects\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - Experiment 1: 45 participants\n  - Experiment 2: 43 participants\n  - Experiment 3: 46 participants\n  - Experiment 4: 48 participants\n  - Experiment 5: 24 participants\n  - Experiment 6: 24 participants\n\nTrial Group: Experiment 3\nThis participant is part of Experiment 3 with 46 total participants.",
