Steven Taylor is a thoughtful and meticulous architect who graduated from the University of California, Berkeley; he starts every morning with a long run through the local park followed by a strong cup of black coffee while reviewing his blueprints; in his spare time, Steven enjoys restoring vintage furniture in his garage workshop to clear his mind and work with his hands; he lives in a modern, light-filled townhouse in a quiet neighborhood that he designed himself to be both functional and aesthetic; Steven maintains a close bond with his younger sister, Sarah, and regularly hosts dinner parties for a tight-knit group of friends he has known since his university days; he is well-regarded by his neighbors for his calm demeanor and his frequent willingness to offer helpful home renovation advice.",
  "experimental_context": "Study: Measures of Anchoring in Estimation Tasks\nDescription: The authors describe a method for the quantitative study of anchoring effects in estimation tasks. A calibration group provides estimates of a set of uncertain quantities. Subjects in the anchored condition first judge whether a specified number (the anchor) is higher or lower than the true value before estimating each quantity. The anchors are set at predetermined percentiles of the distribution of estimates in the calibration group (15th and 85th percentiles in this study). This procedure permits the transformation of anchored estimates into percentiles in the calibration group, allows pooling of results across problems, and provides a natural measure of the size of the effect. The authors illustrate the method by a demonstration that the initial judgment of the anchor is susceptible to an anchoring-like bias and by an analysis of the relation between anchoring and subjective confidence....\nProcedure:\n  1. A calibration group provides numerical estimates and confidence ratings for 15 uncertain quantities.\n  2. Baseline distributions are established, and anchors are set at the 15th and 85th percentiles of the calibration estimates.\n  3. Experimental participants are presented with a quantity and a specified anchor (high or low).\n  4. Participants judge whether the true value of the quantity is higher or lower than the specified anchor.\n  5. Participants provide a numerical estimate for the quantity.\n  6. Participants rate their confidence in their estimate on a 10-point scale.\n  7. In a replication study (Exp 2), a manipulation is added to discredit the informational value of the anchor.\n  8. In a public goods study (Exp 3), participants perform a dichotomous judgment (referendum) before providing a numerical Willingness to Pay (WTP) estimate.\nDesign: Mixed\n\nTrial Groups:\n  - exp_1_calibration: 53 participants\n  - exp_1_anchored_estimation: 103 participants\n  - exp_2_discredited_anchor: 0 participants\n  - exp_3_wtp_estimation: 0 participants",
