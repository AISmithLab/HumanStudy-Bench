## Paper Information
- **Title**: Measures of Anchoring in Estimation Tasks
- **Authors**: Karen E. Jacowitz, Daniel Kahneman
- **Abstract**: The authors describe a method for the quantitative study of anchoring effects in estimation tasks. A calibration group provides estimates of a set of uncertain quantities. Subjects in the anchored condition first judge whether a specified number (the anchor) is higher or lower than the true value before estimating each quantity. The anchors are set at predetermined percentiles of the distribution of estimates in the calibration group (15th and 85th percentiles in this study). This procedure permits the transformation of anchored estimates into percentiles in the calibration group, allows pooling of results across problems, and provides a natural measure of the size of the effect. The authors illustrate the method by a demonstration that the initial judgment of the anchor is susceptible to an anchoring-like bias and by an analysis of the relation between anchoring and subjective confidence.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1: Main Study: Anchoring in Quantitative Estimation
- **Input**: 15 uncertain quantities (e.g., length of Mississippi River, height of Mount Everest). 
Calibration Group: Only the estimation question. 
Anchored Groups: 1. Dichotomous judgment (Is the quantity higher or lower than the anchor?). Anchors were set at the 15th (Low) or 85th (High) percentiles of the calibration distribution. 2. Estimation question.
- **Participants**: 156 students at the University of California, Berkeley. Split into Calibration Group (n=53) and Experimental Groups (n=103).
- **Output**: Numerical estimates for 15 quantities; dichotomous judgments (higher/lower than anchor); confidence ratings (10-point scale). These are used to calculate the Anchoring Index (AI), transformed medians, and correlations between estimates and confidence.
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

### Experiment 2: Replication with Discredited Anchor
- **Input**: Estimation tasks similar to Experiment 1, with anchors set near the 15th and 85th percentiles, plus an added manipulation intended to discredit the informational value of the anchor.
- **Participants**: Not explicitly specified, implied to be similar to Experiment 1 population ('a close replication').
- **Output**: Dichotomous judgments of the anchor (e.g., percentage of high anchors judged low; percentage of low anchors judged high).
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data
- [ ] Can be replicated with LLM agents

### Experiment 3: Anchoring in Estimation vs. Willingness to Pay (WTP)
- **Input**: Three uncertain quantity estimation problems and two Willingness to Pay (WTP) questions for public goods. Five different anchors selected from the calibration distribution were used. Subjects first made a dichotomous judgment (estimation) or answered an equivalent referendum question (WTP), then stated their best numerical estimate or maximal WTP.
- **Participants**: Not explicitly specified (Green, Jacowitz, Kahneman, & McFadden, 1995). Implied to be survey/student respondents.
- **Output**: Percentage of anchored estimates equaling or exceeding the highest anchor (for estimation and WTP problems); percentage of respondents judging the low anchor high or refusing to pay the suggested amount.
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data

## Overall Assessment
- **Overall Replicable**: YES
- **Confidence**: 1.00
- **Notes**: All experiments rely on text-based numerical estimation and judgment tasks, which are suitable for replication using LLM agents. No visual stimuli, reaction time measurements, or highly specific physical requirements were identified.
