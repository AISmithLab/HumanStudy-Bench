- **Content Preview**: Subjects played a series of one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) games against different opponents. Each PD game was presented in three versions (a triad): unknown opponent strategy, opponent known to hav...

## Experiment 2: Newcomb's Problem (Computer Program Version)

### Phenomenon
Quasi-magical Thinking

### Sub-Studies/Scenarios

    {
      "choice": "Both boxes",
      "percentage": "35%",

## Experiment 3: Prisoner's Dilemma with Information Seeking

### Phenomenon
Nonconsequential Information Seeking

### Sub-Studies/Scenarios

#### pd_info_seeking_variation (decision_task)
- **Content Preview**: Subjects were presented with PD games and offered the opportunity to learn the other's decision before choosing, for a very small fee.

    {
      "behavior": "Chose to pay for information",
      "percentage": "81%",
      "context": "Across trials"
    },
    {
      "behavior": "Choice after seeing information",
      "observation": "The great majority of subjects chose to compete regardless of the opponent's decision."
    }
