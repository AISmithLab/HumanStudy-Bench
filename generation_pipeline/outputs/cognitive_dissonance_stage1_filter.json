  "paper_abstract": "The study explores the effect of forced compliance on private opinion. Specifically, it tests the theory of cognitive dissonance, which suggests that if a person is induced to act in a way contrary to their private opinion, they will experience dissonance. To reduce this dissonance, the individual may change their private opinion to align with their behavior. The experiment specifically tests the derivation that the smaller the reward used to elicit the behavior, the greater the magnitude of dissonance and, consequently, the greater the subsequent opinion change. Subjects performed boring tasks and were then paid either $1 or $20 to tell a waiting participant that the tasks were enjoyable. Results showed that participants paid $1 changed their opinions more significantly than those paid $20, supporting the dissonance theory.",

They were then asked by the experimenter to act as a 'hired' assistant and tell a confederate (waiting girl) that the tasks were very interesting and enjoyable. Participants were offered either $1 or $20 for this service (or were in a control group that did not perform the task).",

  "notes": "The experiment is fundamentally reliant on the physical and temporal experience of boredom. Participants must physically handle spools and pegs for a full hour to generate the 'negative opinion' necessary for the dissonance to occur. LLM agents cannot experience physical fatigue, tactile monotony, or the passage of time in a way that replicates the psychological state of a human subject performing these specific motor tasks. Therefore, while the instructions are text-based, the stimulus (the boring task) is sensory and physical.",
