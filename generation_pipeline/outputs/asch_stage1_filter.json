  "paper_abstract": "The paper submits the theory of group forces—specifically suggestion, prestige, and imitation—to a careful examination. It critiques the prevailing view in social psychology that social influence is a 'blind' process where individuals accept opinions arbitrarily regardless of merit. Through a re-examination of representative studies (notably by Lorge and Sherif) and new experimental evidence, the author argues that changes in evaluation are often the result of a cognitive reorganization where the 'object of judgment' is redefined by its context (the author or source), rather than a blind change in judgment of an unchanged object.",

Later, participants rated the same quotations again, but with the true author correctly identified (often representing a change in 'prestige' from the first session). Participants also rated their 'respect' for the political opinions of the authors.",

  "notes": "The paper is a landmark critique of 'prestige suggestion.' While much of the paper involves re-analyzing data from Lorge (1936) and Sherif (1935), Asch provides sufficient procedural detail and quantitative benchmarks (Tables I-VII) for these to be simulated. The core tasks are text-based evaluations, rankings, and interpretations, which are well-suited for LLM agents using persona-based prompting to match the historical participant profiles (e.g., 1930s unemployed adults or college students).",
