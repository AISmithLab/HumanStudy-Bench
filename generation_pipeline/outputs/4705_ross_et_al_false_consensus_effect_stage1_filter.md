# Stage 1: Replicability Filter Review

## Paper Information
- **Title**: The “False Consensus Effect”: An Egocentric Bias in Social Perception and Attribution Processes
- **Authors**: Lee Ross, David Greene, Pamela House
- **Abstract**: Evidence from four studies demonstrates that social observers tend to perceive a “false consensus” with respect to the relative commonness of their own responses. A related bias was shown to exist in the observers’ social inferences. Thus, raters estimated particular responses to be relatively common and relatively unrevealing concerning the actors’ distinguishing personal dispositions when the responses in question were similar to the raters’ own responses; responses differing from those of the rater, by contrast, were perceived to be relatively uncommon and revealing of the actor. These results were obtained both in questionnaire studies presenting subjects with hypothetical situations and choices and in authentic conflict situations. The implications of these findings for our understanding of social perception phenomena and for our analysis of the divergent perceptions of actors and observers are discussed. Finally, cognitive and perceptual mechanisms are proposed which might account for distortions in perceived consensus and for corresponding biases in social inference and attributional processes.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1: Questionnaire study with hypothetical situations
- **Input**: Participants read one of four brief stories (Supermarket, Term Paper, Traffic Ticket, or Space Program) describing a situation ending in a behavioral choice between two options. They were asked to estimate the percentage of their peers who would choose each option before stating their own choice and rating the traits of a 'typical person' who would choose either option.
- **Participants**: 320 Stanford undergraduates (80 for each of the four stories).
- **Output**: Percentage estimates of peer behavior (consensus), participant's own hypothetical choice, and trait ratings on 100-point Likert-type scales for actors choosing either option.
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

### Experiment 2: Questionnaire study on personal characteristics and habits
- **Input**: A questionnaire containing 35 person description items (habits, preferences, fears, expectations, etc.). Each item presented a pair of mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories (e.g., 'Shy' vs 'Not shy').
- **Participants**: 80 Stanford undergraduates.
- **Output**: Self-categorization for each item and estimated percentage of 'college students in general' who fit into each category.
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

### Experiment 3: Hypothetical sandwich board study
- **Input**: A story describing a conflict situation where an experimenter asks the participant to walk around campus for 30 minutes wearing a sandwich board sign (either 'Eat at Joe's' or 'Repent'). The story emphasizes that the participant is not compelled to participate but the experimenter would prefer it.
- **Participants**: 104 Stanford undergraduates.
- **Output**: Hypothetical choice to wear the sign or refuse, consensus estimates for peers, and trait ratings for 'typical' individuals who would agree or refuse.
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data
- [ ] Can be replicated with LLM agents

### Experiment 4: Authentic conflict situation (Sandwich Board)
- **Input**: Participants were actually confronted with an experimenter's request to wear a sandwich board sign on campus. They were also shown 'Likes and Dislikes' questionnaires supposedly filled out by two other participants (one who agreed and one who refused) to use as a basis for trait ratings.
- **Participants**: 80 Stanford undergraduates.
- **Output**: Actual behavioral choice (agreeing to wear the sign or refusing), consensus estimates, and trait ratings of specific individuals (the 'other' participants).
- **Replicable**: NO
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Requires “authentic conflict” / real behavioral compliance (e.g., actually wearing a sign in public, real-world tasks on campus) as the measured dependent variable, Requires real-world physical actions or authentic in-person/social interaction that cannot be faithfully simulated in text-only prompts

## Overall Assessment
- **Overall Replicable**: NO
- **Confidence**: 0.95
- **Notes**: Studies 1, 2, and 3 are purely questionnaire-based using hypothetical scenarios and self-reporting, which are highly suitable for LLM simulation. However, Study 4 is explicitly designed to validate the effect in an 'authentic conflict' situation where the primary measurement is real-world behavioral compliance (actually agreeing to wear a sign in public). This physical, socially-pressured interaction cannot be replicated by text-only agents.
