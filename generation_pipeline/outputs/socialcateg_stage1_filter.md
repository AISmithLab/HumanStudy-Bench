## Paper Information
- **Title**: Social categorization and similarity in intergroup behaviour
- **Authors**: Michael Billig, Henri Tajfel
- **Abstract**: The present study is one of a series exploring the role of social categorization in intergroup behaviour. It has been found in our previous studies that in ‘minimal’ situations, in which the subjects were categorized into groups on the basis of visual judgments they had made or of their esthetic preferences, they clearly discriminated against members of an outgroup although this gave them no personal advantage. However, in these previous studies division into groups was still made on the basis of certain criteria of ‘real‘ similarity between subjects who were assigned to the same category. Therefore, the present study established social categories on an explicitly random basis without any reference to any such real similarity. It was found that, as soon as the notion of ‘group’ was introduced into the situation, the subjects still discriminated against those assigned to another random category. This discrimination was considerably more marked than the one based on a division of subjects in terms of interindividual similarities in which the notion of ‘group’ was never explicitly introduced. In addition, it was found that fairness was also a determinant of the subjects’ decisions. The results are discussed from the point of view of their relevance to a social-cognitive theory of intergroup behaviour.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1: 2 x 2 Factorial Design: Social Categorization vs. Similarity
- **Input**: In Part 1, participants are shown 12 pairs of abstract paintings (Klee vs. Kandinsky) and asked to indicate preferences. In Part 2, participants are assigned to groups (either based on art preference or a random coin toss) or assigned individual code numbers. They then receive a booklet of 24 reward matrices where they must allot money/points to anonymous others identified only by code number and/or group membership.
- **Participants**: 75 boys, aged between 14 and 16, pupils of an independent private school in Bristol.
- **Output**: Numerical distribution of rewards across three matrix types, used to calculate scores for Ingroup Favouritism (FAV), Maximum Joint Profit (MJP), and Fairness (F).
- **Replicable**: NO
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Requires visual input (images, videos, visual stimuli)

## Overall Assessment
- **Overall Replicable**: NO
- **Confidence**: 0.95
- **Notes**: The experiment relies on a visual stimulus task (viewing 12 pairs of abstract paintings) in Part 1 to establish the 'Similarity' independent variable. While the primary dependent variable (matrix reward allocation) is text/numerical, the experimental manipulation itself requires participants to process visual stimuli, which violates the exclusion criteria for LLM agent replication. Additionally, the study specifies a very narrow demographic (14-16 year old British schoolboys from a specific type of private school in the early 1970s), which might be difficult to simulate accurately with modern LLMs without significant bias.
