  "paper_abstract": "The study explores the effect of forced compliance on private opinion. Specifically, it tests the theory of cognitive dissonance, which suggests that if a person is induced to act in a way contrary to their private opinion, they will experience dissonance. To reduce this dissonance, the individual may change their private opinion to align with their behavior. The experiment specifically tests the derivation that the smaller the reward used to elicit the behavior, the greater the magnitude of dissonance and, consequently, the greater the subsequent opinion change. Subjects performed boring tasks and were then paid either $1 or $20 to tell a waiting participant that the tasks were enjoyable. Results showed that participants paid $1 changed their opinions more significantly than those paid $20, supporting the dissonance theory."
