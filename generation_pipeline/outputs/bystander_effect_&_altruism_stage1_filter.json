  "paper_abstract": "Ss overheard an epileptic seizure. They believed either that they alone heard the emergency, or that 1 or 4 unseen others were also present. As predicted the presence of other bystanders reduced the individual's feelings of personal responsibility and lowered his speed of reporting (p < .01). In groups of size 3, males reported no faster than females, and females reported no slower when the 1 other bystander was a male rather than a female. In general, personality and background measures were not predictive of helping. Bystander inaction in real-life emergencies is often explained by \"apathy,\" \"alienation,\" and \"anomie.\" This experiment suggests that the explanation may lie more in the bystander's response to other observers than in his indifference to the victim.",

      "input": "Participants are placed in individual rooms and communicate via an intercom system. They hear a fellow participant (a recording) disclose a history of seizures and subsequently undergo a simulated epileptic seizure. Participants are led to believe they are in a group of 2 (just them and the victim), 3 (them, the victim, and one other), or 6 (them, the victim, and four others).",

  "notes": "The study's primary dependent variable is 'speed of reporting,' measured in seconds. The authors specifically use a 'speed score' based on the reciprocal of response time. Because LLM agents do not have a human-like perception of passing time and cannot produce meaningful 'reaction time' data in a simulated environment that corresponds to physical seconds, this study fails the exclusion criteria for time measurement.",
