# Stage 1: Replicability Filter Review

## Paper Information
- **Title**: Intentional Action and Side-Effects in Ordinary Language
- **Authors**: Joshua Knobe
- **Abstract**: The paper addresses a controversy in the concept of intentional action: whether side-effects of an action are brought about intentionally. The author hypothesizes that people's intuitions are influenced by their attitude toward the specific side-effect. Through two experiments, the author demonstrates an asymmetry: people are considerably more willing to say a side-effect was brought about intentionally when they regard that side-effect as bad (harmful) than when they regard it as good (helpful). This finding suggests that the assignment of praise and blame is at the root of how people apply the concept of intentionality.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1: Corporate Chairman Vignette
- **Input**: Participants read one of two vignettes (harm condition or help condition) about a company chairman who implements a program to increase profits, knowing it will also affect the environment (either harming or helping it). The chairman explicitly states he does not care about the environmental effect.
- **Participants**: 78 people spending time in a Manhattan public park.
- **Output**: 1. Blame/praise rating for the chairman (scale 0-6). 2. Categorical judgment on whether the chairman 'intentionally' harmed/helped the environment.
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

### Experiment 2: Military Lieutenant Vignette
- **Input**: Participants read one of two vignettes (harm condition or help condition) about a military lieutenant who orders a squad to a hill to take control of it, knowing it will result in soldiers either being killed (harm) or rescued (help). The lieutenant explicitly states he does not care about the soldiers' fate.
- **Participants**: 42 people spending time in a Manhattan public park.
- **Output**: 1. Blame/praise rating for the lieutenant. 2. Categorical judgment on whether the lieutenant 'intentionally' put the soldiers in/took them out of the line of fire.
- **Replicable**: YES
- **Exclusion Reasons**: None

## Overall Assessment
- **Overall Replicable**: YES
- **Confidence**: 1.00
- **Notes**: The paper is a classic in experimental philosophy and is highly suitable for LLM replication. The stimuli consist entirely of short text vignettes, and the questions are simple Likert-type scales or binary choices. All vignettes and the specific questions asked are included in the text of the paper.
