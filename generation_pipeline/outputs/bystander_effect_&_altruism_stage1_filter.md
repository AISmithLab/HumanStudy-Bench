# Stage 1: Replicability Filter Review

## Paper Information
- **Title**: BYSTANDER INTERVENTION IN EMERGENCIES: DIFFUSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
- **Authors**: John M. Darley, Bibb Latané
- **Abstract**: Ss overheard an epileptic seizure. They believed either that they alone heard the emergency, or that 1 or 4 unseen others were also present. As predicted the presence of other bystanders reduced the individual's feelings of personal responsibility and lowered his speed of reporting (p < .01). In groups of size 3, males reported no faster than females, and females reported no slower when the 1 other bystander was a male rather than a female. In general, personality and background measures were not predictive of helping. Bystander inaction in real-life emergencies is often explained by "apathy," "alienation," and "anomie." This experiment suggests that the explanation may lie more in the bystander's response to other observers than in his indifference to the victim.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1: Effect of Group Size and Composition on Bystander Intervention
- **Input**: Participants are placed in individual rooms and communicate via an intercom system. They hear a fellow participant (a recording) disclose a history of seizures and subsequently undergo a simulated epileptic seizure. Participants are led to believe they are in a group of 2 (just them and the victim), 3 (them, the victim, and one other), or 6 (them, the victim, and four others).
- **Participants**: 72 students (59 female, 13 male) from introductory psychology courses at New York University.
- **Output**: The percentage of participants who report the emergency and the 'speed score' (the reciprocal of the time elapsed from the start of the fit until the participant left their room to seek help).
- **Replicable**: NO
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Requires time perception/measurement (reaction time, duration judgments)

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data

## Overall Assessment
- **Overall Replicable**: NO
- **Confidence**: 1.00
- **Notes**: The study's primary dependent variable is 'speed of reporting,' measured in seconds. The authors specifically use a 'speed score' based on the reciprocal of response time. Because LLM agents do not have a human-like perception of passing time and cannot produce meaningful 'reaction time' data in a simulated environment that corresponds to physical seconds, this study fails the exclusion criteria for time measurement.
