## Paper Information
- **Title**: Sympathy and callousness: The impact of deliberative thought on donations to identifiable and statistical victims
- **Authors**: Deborah A. Small, George Loewenstein, Paul Slovic
- **Abstract**: When donating to charitable causes, people do not value lives consistently. Money is often concentrated on a single victim even though more people would be helped, if resources were dispersed or spent protecting future victims. We examine the impact of deliberating about donation decisions on generosity. In a series of field experiments, we show that teaching or priming people to recognize the discrepancy in giving toward identifiable and statistical victims has perverse effects: individuals give less to identifiable victims but do not increase giving to statistical victims, resulting in an overall reduction in caring and giving. Thus, it appears that, when thinking deliberatively, people discount sympathy towards identifiable victims but fail to generate sympathy toward statistical victims.

## Experiments Overview

### Experiment 1: Effects of teaching about identifiability on donations
- **Input**: Participants earned $5 for a survey, then received a charity request letter for 'Save the Children'. Conditions: Identifiable Victim (text description + picture of Rokia) vs. Statistical Victim (factual data). Half received an intervention (a brief lesson about the identifiable victim effect bias).
- **Participants**: 121 individuals seated alone in a student center at a university in Pennsylvania.
- **Output**: Actual donation amount ($0-$5) and self-reported affective/moral reactions ('feelings' scale).
- **Replicable**: NO
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Requires visual input (images, videos, visual stimuli), Requires 'authentic conflict' / real behavioral compliance (e.g., actually wearing a sign in public, real-world tasks on campus) as the measured dependent variable

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data
- [ ] Can be replicated with LLM agents

### Experiment 2: Framing effects of the debiasing intervention
- **Input**: Similar to Study 1, but all participants received a 'teaching' intervention. The frame was manipulated: 'more to identifiable victims' vs. 'less to statistical victims'.
- **Participants**: 99 individuals in public places around a university in Pennsylvania.
- **Output**: Actual donation amount ($0-$5).
- **Replicable**: NO
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Requires visual input (images, videos, visual stimuli), Requires 'authentic conflict' / real behavioral compliance (e.g., actually wearing a sign in public, real-world tasks on campus) as the measured dependent variable

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data
- [ ] Can be replicated with LLM agents

### Experiment 3: Implicit debiasing via joint presentation
- **Input**: Participants received a charity request in one of three conditions: (1) Identifiable victim (description + picture), (2) Statistical victims (factual info), or (3) Joint presentation (Identifiable victim with statistical information).
- **Participants**: 159 individuals in a university center and courtyard.
- **Output**: Actual donation amount ($0-$5).
- **Replicable**: NO
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Requires visual input (images, videos, visual stimuli), Requires 'authentic conflict' / real behavioral compliance (e.g., actually wearing a sign in public, real-world tasks on campus) as the measured dependent variable

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data
- [ ] Can be replicated with LLM agents

### Experiment 4: Priming modes of thought (Calculative vs. Feeling)
- **Input**: Participants first completed a priming task: Calculation priming (math problems) or Feeling priming (impression/emotion questions). Then they received a charity request (Identifiable vs. Statistical victim).
- **Participants**: 165 students and others on campus at a university in Pennsylvania.
- **Output**: Actual donation amount ($0-$5).
- **Replicable**: NO
- **Exclusion Reasons**: Requires visual input (images, videos, visual stimuli), Requires 'authentic conflict' / real behavioral compliance (e.g., actually wearing a sign in public, real-world tasks on campus) as the measured dependent variable

#### Checklist:
- [ ] No visual input required
- [ ] No time perception/measurement required
- [ ] Participant profile can be constructed
- [ ] Has quantitative/statistical data
- [ ] Can be replicated with LLM agents

## Overall Assessment
- **Overall Replicable**: NO
- **Confidence**: 0.95
- **Notes**: The research is fundamentally based on field experiments measuring actual monetary donations. LLM agents cannot faithfully replicate the 'real behavioral compliance' of donating money they have just physically earned. Furthermore, the 'Identifiable Victim' manipulation relies on a visual stimulus (a photograph of a child) which is not provided in the paper and cannot be processed by text-only LLM agents. While the text of the charity requests and some priming items are present, the core psychological triggers (visual identification and real financial stakes) are missing or non-simulatable.
