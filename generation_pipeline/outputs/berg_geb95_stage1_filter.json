  "paper_abstract": "We designed an experiment to study trust and reciprocity in an investment setting. This design controls for alternative explanations of behavior including repeat game reputation effects, contractual precommitments, and punishment threats. Observed decisions suggest that reciprocity exists as a basic element of human behavior and that this is accounted for in the trust extended to an anonymous counterpart. A second treatment, social history, identifies conditions which strengthen the relationship between trust and reciprocity.",

They are instructed on the rules of the investment game: Room A subject sends $Ma to Room B, the amount is tripled to $3Ma, and Room B subject decides how much ($kb) to return. Instructions include a double-blind procedure to ensure anonymity.",

  "notes": "The experiments are classic economic games (Investment/Trust Game) with clearly defined numerical inputs and outputs. The 'social history' component is provided as a text-based summary table (found in Appendix A), which is highly suitable for LLM prompting. While the original study used a physical implementation (envelopes and mailboxes) to ensure double-blind anonymity, the logical structure of the game is purely text-based and decision-driven.",
