# Stage 2: Study & Data Extraction Review

## Experiment 1: The Investigation of Lorge (Re-analysis)

### Phenomenon
The effect of 'prestige' (attributed authorship) on the evaluation of political and economic statements.

### Sub-Studies/Scenarios

#### Lorge Original Procedure (task)
- **Content Preview**: Subjects rated 50 brief quotations on a 5-point scale (1 = extreme agreement, 5 = negative extreme). Each quotation was followed by two names, one being the true source. Subjects selected the true author. After 2 weeks to a month, subjects rated the same quotations again, this time with only the true author identified. They also rated their 'respect' for the political opinions of the authors on a 5-point scale....

## Experiment 3: Sherif's Investigation of Prestige

### Phenomenon
The effect of author prestige on the ranking of literary prose passages.

### Sub-Studies/Scenarios

#### Literary Quality Ranking (task)
- **Content Preview**: Subjects ranked 16 brief prose passages (all written by Robert Louis Stevenson but attributed to different authors) according to literary quality. They had previously ranked the authors themselves in terms of literary status....
