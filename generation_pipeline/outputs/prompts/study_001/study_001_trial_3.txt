SCENARIO: It is proposed in Congress that the space program be revived and that large sums be allocated for the manned and unmanned exploration of the moon and planets nearest Earth. Supporters of the proposal argue that it will provide jobs, spur technology, and promote national pride and unity. Opponents argue that a space program will either necessitate higher taxes, or else drain money from important domestic priorities. Furthermore, they deny that it will accomplish the desirable effects claimed by the program’s supporters. Both sides, of course, refute each other’s claims and ultimately a public referendum is held.
