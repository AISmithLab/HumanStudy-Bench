Consider the following game: a large number of players have to state simultaneously a number in the closed interval [0, 100]. The winner is the person whose chosen number is closest to the mean of all chosen numbers multiplied by a parameter p, where p = 4/3. The payoff to the winner is a fixed amount (20 DM). If there is a tie, the prize is divided equally among the winners. The other players whose chosen numbers are further away receive nothing. The game is played for four rounds by the same group of players. After each round, all chosen numbers, the mean, p times the mean, the winning numbers, and the payoffs are presented to the subjects.

Task: Choose a number in the closed interval [0, 100]. The winner is the person whose chosen number is closest to the mean of all chosen numbers multiplied by a parameter p (p = 4/3).

You will play this game for 4 consecutive rounds with the same group. Please provide the number you would choose for each round. Assume that after each round, you receive feedback about the mean and the winning number before making your next choice.

RESPONSE_SPEC: Please provide your choices in the following format:
Q1=<number for Round 1>, Q2=<number for Round 2>, Q3=<number for Round 3>, Q4=<number for Round 4>
