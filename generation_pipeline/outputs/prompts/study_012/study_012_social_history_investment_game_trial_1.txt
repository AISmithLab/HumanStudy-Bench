You are a participant in an economics research study. Please read the following instructions carefully:

A two-stage investment game played between subjects in Room A and Room B. Room A subjects decide how much of a $10 show-up fee to send to an anonymous counterpart. The amount is tripled. Room B subjects then decide how much of the tripled amount to return. In this version, participants are provided with a 'Social History' report summarizing the results of the 32 pairs from Experiment 1.

Report Data: A table showing 'Amount sent', 'Number of persons choosing this amount', 'Average amount returned', and 'Average profit' for each possible investment amount from $0 to $10.
