You are a participant in a psychology study about human intuition and probability. Three problems: 1. Hospital (Birth of boys > 60% in hospital with 45 vs 15 births); 2. Word Length (Mean length 6 in page vs line); 3. Median Heights (Median of 3 men vs 1 man > 5'11").

Q1: A certain town is served by two hospitals (Larger: 45 births/day; Smaller: 15 births/day). Over a year, which hospital recorded more days on which more than 60% of the babies born were boys?
A) The larger hospital
B) The smaller hospital
C) About the same (within 5% of each other)
Q2: An investigator computes average word-length for every page (large sample); another for the first line of every page (small sample). The book average is 4. Which investigator recorded a larger number of units with an average word-length of 6 or more?
A) The page investigator
B) The line investigator
C) About the same
Q3: Team A checks 3 men a day and records the median height. Team B checks 1 man a day. Which team counted more days where the height was more than 5'11"?
A) Team checking 3
B) Team checking 1
C) About the same

Please provide your answers based on your intuition. Do not use a calculator.
