INSTRUCTIONS:
Participants produced subjective sampling distributions for three sample sizes (N = 10, 100, 1000) across three different populations. They were asked to assign percentages to categories such that they add up to 100%.

SCENARIO/QUESTION:
A regional induction center records the average height of the N men who are examined every day. The average height of the male population lies between 170-175 cm. Frequency of heights decreases with distance from the mean. Produce a sampling distribution of average height in seven categories: up to 160, 160-165, 165-170, 170-175, 175-180, 180-185, more than 185. [Sample Size N = 10]
