Q1 (answer with number only): Consider two very large decks of cards, denoted A and B. In deck A, p of the cards are marked X, and (1-p) are marked O. In deck B, (1-p) of the cards are marked X, and p are marked O. One of the decks has been selected by chance, and N cards have been drawn at random from it, of which r are marked X and b are marked O. What do you think the probability is that the N cards were drawn from deck A? (Condition: p=5/6, sample=4:2)
