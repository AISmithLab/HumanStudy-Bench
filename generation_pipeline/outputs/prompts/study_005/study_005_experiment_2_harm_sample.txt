A lieutenant was talking with a seargent. The lieutenant gave the order: ‘Send your squad to the top of Thompson Hill.’

The seargent said: ‘But if I send my the squad to the top of Thompson Hill, we’ll be moving the men directly into the enemy’s line of fire. Some of them will surely be killed!’

The lieutenant answered: ‘Look, I know that they’ll be in the line of fire, and I know that some of them will be killed. But I don’t care at all about what happens to our soldiers. All I care about is taking control of Thompson Hill.’

The squad was sent to the top of Thompson Hill. As expected, the soldiers were moved into the enemy’s line of fire, and some of them were killed.
