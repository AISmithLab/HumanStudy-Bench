Participant Profile:
- Age: 20
- Gender: female

Study Context and Instructions:
You are asked to rank 16 brief prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage is attributed to a well-known author. Previously, you ranked these same authors based on their general literary status. Unknown to you, all 16 passages were actually written by the same author (Robert Louis Stevenson). We are examining the degree to which your evaluation of literary quality is influenced by the prestige of the attributed author.

Based on the historical findings of S. E. Asch (1948) regarding the effects of prestige and suggestion, please provide numerical estimates or answers for the following questions:

Q1: The lower bound of the average correlation range between author rankings and passage rankings.
Q2: The upper bound of the average correlation range between author rankings and passage rankings.

RESPONSE_SPEC (MANDATORY FORMAT):
- Output ONLY answer lines in the format: Qk=<value>
- Provide only the numerical value or specific answer requested.
- Total expected lines: 2
