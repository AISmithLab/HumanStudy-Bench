  "paper_abstract": "When donating to charitable causes, people do not value lives consistently. Money is often concentrated on a single victim even though more people would be helped, if resources were dispersed or spent protecting future victims. We examine the impact of deliberating about donation decisions on generosity. In a series of field experiments, we show that teaching or priming people to recognize the discrepancy in giving toward identifiable and statistical victims has perverse effects: individuals give less to identifiable victims but do not increase giving to statistical victims, resulting in an overall reduction in caring and giving. Thus, it appears that, when thinking deliberatively, people discount sympathy towards identifiable victims but fail to generate sympathy toward statistical victims.",

LLM agents cannot faithfully replicate the 'real behavioral compliance' of donating money they have just physically earned. Furthermore, the 'Identifiable Victim' manipulation relies on a visual stimulus (a photograph of a child) which is not provided in the paper and cannot be processed by text-only LLM agents. While the text of the charity requests and some priming items are present, the core psychological triggers (visual identification and real financial stakes) are missing or non-simulatable.",
