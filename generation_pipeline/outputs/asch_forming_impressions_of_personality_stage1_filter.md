# Stage 1: Replicability Filter Review

## Paper Information
- **Title**: FORMING IMPRESSIONS OF PERSONALITY
- **Authors**: S. E. ASCH
- **Abstract**: This classic study investigates the processes by which unified impressions of personality are formed. The author challenges the view that impressions are formed by the simple summation of independent traits. Through a series of experiments, Asch demonstrates that certain 'central' traits (such as 'warm' and 'cold') have a disproportionate effect on the final impression, while other 'peripheral' traits have less impact. The research also explores how the meaning of a trait changes depending on its context and the order in which information is received (the primacy effect). The findings suggest that impressions are structured wholes rather than mere collections of discrete characteristics.

## Overall Assessment
- **Overall Replicable**: YES
- **Confidence**: 1.00
- **Notes**: Asch's experiments are quintessential examples of text-based social psychology. Because they rely entirely on the presentation of trait lists (stimuli) and the collection of written sketches or check-list responses (data), they are perfectly suited for replication using LLM agents. There are no visual stimuli, real-world interactions, or timing-based measurements involved.
