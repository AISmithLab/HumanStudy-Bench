It critiques the prevailing view in social psychology that social influence is a 'blind' process where individuals accept opinions arbitrarily regardless of merit. Through a re-examination of representative studies (notably by Lorge and Sherif) and new experimental evidence, the author argues that changes in evaluation are often the result of a cognitive reorganization where the 'object of judgment' is redefined by its context (the author or source), rather than a blind change in judgment of an unchanged object."
