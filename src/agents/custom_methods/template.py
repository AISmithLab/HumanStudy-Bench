Template for creating custom system prompt methods.

To create your own method:
1. Copy this file and rename it (e.g., "v4_emotional.py", "my_custom_prompt.py")
2. Implement the generate_prompt function below
3. Place it in this directory (src/agents/custom_methods/)
4. The method will be automatically discovered and registered using the filename

Example usage:
    python scripts/run_v1_v2_pipeline.py --real-llm --presets v4_emotional
